So you nah stop, no time, no time for ya dear

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related


That girl is a real crowd pleaser 
Small world, all her friends know of me 
Young bull livin' like an old geezer 
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly 
Frat girls still tryna get even 
Haters mad for whatever reason 
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' 
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle"

And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet

Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

And make your body a whole manuscript


I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places
Let me exceed your danger zones
Until you cause your screams
And forgot your last name


If I ask you a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you are thinking about it
I've been trying for a while, this is giving and giving it
You know your heart with me makes you bam-bam
You know that baby is looking for my bam-bam
Come, proof of my mouth to see how you know you
I want, I want, I want to see how much love you can
I am in a hurry, I want to take the trip
We start slowly, then wild


Passy step, soft soft
We saw us' hitting, little to little
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are a delicacy malice

Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

She said she twenty-one, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from Can you take me here? to screenin' out the lane
Went from Damn, this nigga lame to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery 
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's comin', it's a minute away
I saw people marchin' in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people followin' their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understandin', positivity

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye


Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye


I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

He know I'm a fashion killa, word to John Galliano

How y'all wifing these thots? You don't get wins for that

Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks
I'm in that cherry red foreign with the brown guts
My shit slappin' like dude did LeBron's nuts


All you girls in here
If you're feelin' thirsty
Come on take a sip
'Cause you know what I'm servin'

I don't care about anything
Neither the day nor the time
If I have lost everything
You have left me in the shadows
I swear I think about you
I make the best attempt
Time goes slow
And I'm dying

If night comes and you don't answer
I swear I am waiting for your door
I live spending the nights
And I'm still singing under the full moon

Do not leave me in this loneliness I ask you

I want to heat only once again
I can't take it anymore, I want to see you already

Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress with kisses slowly
I sign on your labyrinth walls
And make your body a whole manuscript


I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places
Let me exceed your danger zones
Until you cause your screams
And forgot your last name


If I ask you a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you are thinking about it
I've been trying for a while, this is giving and giving it
You know your heart with me makes you bom, bom
You know that baby is looking for my bom, bom
Come, proof of my mouth to see how you know you
I want, I want, I want to see how much love you can
I am in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are a delicacy malice
Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
And this beauty is a puzzle
But pa 'assemble it here I have the piece
Hey!

Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress with kisses slowly
I sign on your labyrinth walls
And make your body a whole manuscript


I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places
Let me exceed your danger zones
Until you cause your screams
And forgot your last name

Slowly
This is How We Do It Down in Puerto Rico
I Just Wanna Hear You Screaming, Oh, Blessed!
I Can Move Forever when I am with you
Báila it!

Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places

Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit

I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours

Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately

See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...


Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?

I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else


If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now , I'm high now 
I'm high now , I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things


If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

I'm high now , I'm high now 
I'm high now , I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

Now

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines


I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn


God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all


Verse 2 says, You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

Some days I'm nice, some days I can be a bitch
Some days I'm strong, some days I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit


I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl, I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke

I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl

And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies


But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side


So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too


But you gotta be there for me too


Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side


So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you


I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too


But you gotta be there for me too


Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Said I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too

Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good


I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends?


Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left 
Wonderin' if you think about me 
Actually, don't answer that 

Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good

But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes


Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter-
​flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—


I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus

I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, This shit is garbage
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…


I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water

But only when it freezes


'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh


It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
​pectations and meet 'em, but first
The Speedom verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes


'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown


'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain

My name's , my name's 
River , river run
Call me , call me 
River , we'll let the river run


Always the bridesmaid, never The bride, hey!
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise

But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear

Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door


A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade


And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time


But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun


There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom


Well, tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you


And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?


Here's to you


Raise a glass for everyone


Here's to them


Underneath that burning sun

Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Uh, I ain't really with the razzle dazzle 
Knock him off and then I throw him off the boat paddle 
Go to Tijuana, put the kilo on the saddle 
Sack him, hit a lick and cop a pterodactyl 
Pap him, choppa biting down like an apple 
Mansion with the acres with the horses and the cattle 

Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo 
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say Hasta luego 
Muy Bien wrap a kilos 
Snub nose with potatoes
Straight out the jungle 

This real rap, no mumble 

My skin black like mamba 
Got stash boxes in Hondas 
Straight out the jungle
Magnífico, arriba, arriba


Take-Takeoff
No monkey in the jungle block hot like a sauna 
Bustas knocking on me, tryna weave with anacondas 
Jumpin' in the water, tryna sneak across the water grass 
Gotta seek guards out, got me bit by a piranha 
I'll bag it, bag of money, know I gotta have it
Savage, but I'm still a gentleman in Cali 
Static, nigga turn to mean about the cabbage 
Kill his whole family if he run off with your package 
I just put a pack on the way to Bogota 
Poke his eyes out, ain't no tellin' what he saw 
I'ma wire his jaw, I don't know if he will talk 
Get the chainsaw and I'ma saw his legs off 
They knew that we was gang but they sayin' that we a ring 
Investigatin', takin' pictures of the whole team 
Undercover, tryna do a sting
10 mil' on a plane, going straight to Medellín

Trapping like the narco 
Got dope like Pablo 
Cut throat like Pablo 
Chop trees with the Draco 
On the Nawf, got Diego 
Say Hasta luego 
Muy Bien wrap a kilo 
Snub nose with potatoes
Straight out the jungle 

This real rap, no mumble

Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

I hope someday we'll sit down together

Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar 
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka 
Te vamos a tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pa'l carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah 
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada 
Pa-Pa-Paparazzi like I'm Lady Gaga 
Y no te me hagas 
Que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara 
No salgo de tu mente 
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado Mi Gente
Yo no soy hype, soy como el Testarossa 
Yo soy el que se la vive y también el que la goza 
Es la cosa, mami es la cosa 
El que mira sufre y el que toca goza 

I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that

We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust

Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out

Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn"

This E 'The True Remix, Baby!
That is like this
I spend a lot of 'night' thinking
I don't know how or when it was
But I only know that I remembered
How did I do it that time
Yes, I can't follow alone
But I know I bot


From my life I bot, Yeh, and I bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pal 'fuck usté' left, and you left '
From my life I bot, I bot, Yeh, Yeh, Mommy


Baby, life e 'a cycle
And what does not use it does not recycle
So my life move
That if I put it e 'pa' remember a t.b.t., Yeh
I already tired of your lie '
Now there is a tougher that throws me
Everything has its end, everything expires
You ere 'past and the past never turns
Pal 'fuck, my body does not need you
What he asks and 'a dirty perreo in the placita
I don't think ours is repeated
Give him, turn on a phillie, leave one read for now, Yeh

I hate to know that in you once 'more' I trusted
I hate to 'it' I love you that a thousand sees' I text you
Baby, better than you, now I have as die '
Ours was in a bugatti and you stayed on foot


I bothered you;I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pal 'fuck I sent you, I sent you
And your friend was nailed, I nailed it
Fuck you, son 'e whore, Yeh



Baby, I bot
And since I gave you that 'Botá', the cat 'are from tre' in tre '
If you want, 'ask, if you don't believe me'
That I no longer have noise ', pa' complete the rows are express
Did you see how the world went to Revé '?
And I with her in R.D., that I fell in love with the day I tried it
I don't think I come back and give you, Mommy, because the service was canceled
If I do not answer the problem, it will touch background
Mommy, breathe deep while I hide it
With you forcing today I put the condom
But posta'o a half court, baby, like Rondón
I gave you a hard burial
I know that over time the wound is cured
E 'that in Verdá' that you are not 'at that point
I swear to you, although I did not swear

Baby, I bot
I gave you a band and I released you
Pa'l Carajo I sent you, huh, eh
From my life I took you, huh, huh



Pa'l fucking you bot
I feel good without you
I no longer suffer for Amore ', now Romo heart'
And there are plenty of the paca 'of one hundred
You broke my heart
Meaningless
But I have a new ass that gives me a lot of love
And I fuck well bastard


I don't vary it to you that I suffered, I had a bad time
But I overcome you and from my life I bot
And I gave you a band and I released you
And I don't want to know about you
And for the fuck I sent you, I'm going to drink today


Ozuna
From my life I bot and I know that no one '
I will spend my whole life asking where it was
But your friend texts me whenever she wishes me
A photo is thrown with me and tells me: so that you see it

I turn on to see if I forget
From your name, your kiss ', your body, your groan'
I did it in the car, I shouted in my ear
I close the eye 'and I think of everything I did', Baby
I turn on to see if I forget
From your name, your kiss ', your body, your groan'
I did it in the car, I shouted in my ear
I close the eye 'and I think of everything I did', Baby


Nio!
I gave you trust and you failed me
You made fun of me and you humiliated me
LEJO 'You left and you didn't explain
You saw my movie and you turned
Does now want to know what I think about you?
I feel bastard because you are not here
Just as you came


I'm not going to deny that I suffered, I had a bad time
But I overcame and my life bot, and I bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pa'l Carajo I sent you, I sent you
And from my life I took you out, I took you
Baby, I bot


I mention if I do not need when your skin touched me

I lie if I say I do not need to call dawn

Asking me to grip you hard in bed and make my wife

I take advantage of the remix with ozu 'to send you pars



I don't want a lie 'or your falsehood
I'm leaving the street tonight to rumbar
I drink two drinks' and I'm going to forget you
I go with the babys who want to play

I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead 
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break 
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break again

Lost in the millions?

You, oh


Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, oh
You've got me fe–
You, oh, ayy


Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is Leave me alone
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, Why let the story run if it's false?
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

All of this disorder, no addressin'

There's a whole lot in my possession

After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'

I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed

I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself

Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for four weeks
I told her go on a date
All of a sudden, she married
Didn’t say get bloodclaat married


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you


— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alright"

When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose they respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step

I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all they statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, How Does It Feel?
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing
Tempt me, drive me
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you"

Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job

Can't offer much more, you've heard it before

I wanna let you know there's more to me

He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, Do anything, but just don't lie to me
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me

Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird


Rest in peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up


Jump inside, oh, won't you roll with us?
Make the devil bite the angel dust
Shawty got a thing for us, shawty, what you want?
Tell me what you like, tell me what you want

Rest In Peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly, yeah 
I just took a four to the head like man 
Drop the top on the slab like man 
Off the top of the dome like man 
Nothin' beatin' home like man 
In the Screw tape zone like man 
I go Pimp C on the phone like man 
Flip say platinum, don't do chrome like man
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon 
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose 
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food 
Pass the plate , where my drink ?
This my day , lucky you, fuck you too, woo!


Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room , give me some room , give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move , give me the juice


Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished 
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' 
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' 
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys 
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time 
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies 
Run at you hard like a sumo 
They say I talk like a chulo 
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno 
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo 
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno 
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo 
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now 
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down 
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down 
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now 
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke 
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope 
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road 
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower 

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way , I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em 
Wasn't in it for the trophies , just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? 


I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, What the fuck happened to hip-hop?
I said, I don't have any answers
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers 
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap 
Let's recap, way back, MC's that 
Wreak havoc on tape decks 
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap , and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact , where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though 
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho 
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker 
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA 
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall 
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room , give me some room , give me the juice
Hop out the coupe , hop out the coupe , hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move , give me the juice"

*Plane crash*
Yeah 
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out 
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe Stan just isn't your cup of tea 
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L 
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? 
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick 
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up 
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us 
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me 
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me 
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest 
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
Dawg, that's a date — Looks like an olive to me
Look, there's an apple! — No, it's not, it's a peach!
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! 
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done 
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, Only when it comes to ink and lyricists
But my beef is more media journalists

I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer

Sayin’ I should quit 
I fuckin' tell 'em make me 
Eat a fuckin’ dick 
I'm feelin' like the greatest 
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics


I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day 
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain 
Feel like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure 
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

Greatest in the world 
Greatest in the world 
Greatest in the world 
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it 
The best to ever do it 
The best to ever do it 
I feel like the greatest 
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good 
Never be as good 
 Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest


So you sold ten million albums, eh? 
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? 
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, Die Antwoord!
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress 
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget though, and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it 
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit 
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world

I feel like the greatest 
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good 
Never be as good 
 Wife-beaters, white t-shirts, what?
But I'm the greatest


Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention 
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension 
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine 
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad 
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene 
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the Sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean 
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s 
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding  hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling 
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day  I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world

I don't do Jordans and Audemars

I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me 
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? 
I'm confused tryna figure out
How to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Prolly rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel

When the cops hit us up, we can flush this shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follow or
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts

It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot

Three's not a crowd all up in it

Don't fall on my face

Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–


Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case 
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say 
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made Not Afraid 
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away 
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY 
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once 
You wanted Shady? You got him!

Don't fall on my face 
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate 
Don't fall on my faith, oh 
Don't fall on my fate 


Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches 
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly 
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, Hold your head up! —Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead —Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show , sorry if I took forever 

Don't fall on my face 
Don't fall on my faith, oh 
Don't fall on my fate 
Don't fall on my faith, oh 
Don't fall on my fate 


Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew 
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine 
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host 
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats 
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer 
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started 
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home 
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! 

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot

2018,  well


Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—


Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, FACK 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold?
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—


Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, FACK 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Take a look at what I've done


I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is


Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick , 12 inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Gettin' in relationships like this? 
Maybe it says somethin' about me 
Should I look in the mirror?


I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together


She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal


And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 9-1-1 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty?
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
To a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognized me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window 
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo 
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you You're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!


If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones


It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More to try talkin' you into comin' up off it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind


I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones


Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-E-lope
Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho 
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers 
To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight-nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, Marshall, what a skank I've been.
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him.
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the grey skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him 
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream Fuck you! 
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in

Ooh, think it's vegetables
Ooh, think it's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond No. 9 now
Section full of fine dimes
Bitches starin' at me sayin', Wow
Unforgettable , like Nat King Cole
Gucci Barry White, I'm singing to your ho
A one man show , a human bankroll
She lost in the sauce  'cause Gucci got the glow

I drink 'til I'm drunk , smoke 'til I'm high
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly
The ladies love luxury, that's why they all fuck with me
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly


Now watch me fly
Now watch me fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly


Kodak, Kodak
I'm so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I'm smokin' this cherry pie so much but this my life
I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tech when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop fifty-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak, take a pic
I came home and dropped a hit
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled
Cutlass sittin' high , I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing

I drink 'til I'm drunk , smoke 'til I'm high
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly
The ladies love luxury , that's why they all fuck with me
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly
I know I'm super fly


Now, now watch me fly
Now watch me fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, Woo!
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
Wit' your corny lines —ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you 
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead 
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still 
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay, so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist 
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this 
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! 
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven, you'd look up to me
And for the record, you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write Not Alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells, attempt fails! Budden, L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it 
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it 
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers 
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'—, oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you"

Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow

Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! 
You fucking with Wayne's!? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

She say, Ooh, daddy, ooh,
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile 
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, Ooh, dead emotion 
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"

C5


Don't cry , don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah


Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, Don’t cry, stay tuned
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry , don’t go 
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah
Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie 
I fuckin' love you, woah 


Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, It's just you and I
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll 

Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie , I fuckin' love you, woah

Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah 


Don't cry, stay tuned

Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300

Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me No once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one

They don't love me, he doesn't value you
He doesn't greet you or tell you Hello
And they don't talk to me at any time
You live in one corner and I live in the other
And I look at you to see when e 'the time

To talk to you;I want to tell you, I want to explain you, ma ’

Who did a lot for this day to be able to approach more ', more'
I can't anymore, you have to listen
What I came to offer, ey

A-a-a-beacrate, leave the doubt
The night and 'cold but with me e' safe
Despise bitterness
And let me take your due height
Of your 'follies, of your ideas
Of your culture and your science
Will I reach it?I don't know that, but tonight-


Ah ...
I know I'm very annoying, but I want to tell you that ...


You don't escape from me
I don't keep the 'word' tonight
I always dreamed of having this evening
And that I have to tell you
What do not escape from me

Ho thicker-thicker-thicker than a fuckin' Snicker
Drug dealer, professional pot-whipper
In the winter, buy your ho a chinchilla
I just bought my bitch them Kylie Jenner lip fillers


Man, oh my God
She Instagram famous but she can't keep a job
Man, oh my God
Swipe her 30-inch weave on her sugar daddy card
Man, oh my God
Her doctor got her bustin' out her motherfuckin' bra
Man, oh my God
She Uber to a nigga with no car

Talkin' 'bout the relish, I do not embellish
Jacket got wings, True's got propellers
Gave all my old Margielas to my boy Marcellus
Pulled up with no laces, had the whole block jealous
Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't need advice
Wild nigga life, tell 'em read my rights
Man it hot tonight, lucky I wore my ice
15 in the game, baby girl, I got stripes


Ka-Ka-Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls


I was out in Spain rockin' a Medusa head
I ain't never have to give a rap producer head
If I do, though, I'ma write a book like Supahead
This ain't wonder that I'm makin', this that super bread
Splish, splash, fuck him in a hurry, quick, fast
Still a pink wig, thick ass, whiplash
Got him cummin', cummin', Roger, over, dispatch
Said my box is the best, he met his match
I got all these bitches wantin' to be Barbie dolls
Barbie Dreamhouse, pink and purple marble walls
Pull-Pull up in that Barbie 'Rari, finna bury y'all
She threw dirt on my name, ended up at her own burial

Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall

Make her spend that money, dummy, go retarded for me

I'MMA Show you Why i'm The King of This Shit
Uah



When a woman decides to be bad and does not want owner
Probably a man cheated on her in her life, without feelings
Rumba, the past buried him in the grave
The bad has life, the good is the deceased
Now, Pal 'Cajo the envy of all
Every bobolon that approaches her ignores it
So quiet that it was the baby
Now it's Candela
I see her hunting with twenty bottles
I feel a problem
I am helpful with your wishes
If he asks me to
I don't like shamaquitas
I just do what the baby excites
He failed him-ó and betrayed him-ó
Now she is going to take revenge on my bed

She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar
She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar


In the Phantom I am going to look for you
Baby, you will never forget me
I need to be taught to love
Baby, I vo 'to devour
Baby, your body and you excite me
Inside you need me '
You are always going to be my devil
My loquita, wetted '
Your body and you excite me
Inside you need me '
You are always going to be my devil
My loquita, very beautiful


She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar
She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar

She looked at me from Lejo '
Dancing in a Romeo thread
I never listened to the 'advice'
In your eyes I always see my reflexes
He failed-ó -ó and betrayed her-ó
She got drunk-hea and she escaped. ""
Twenty bottle ', pink champagne
The baby wanted me
A Diablita, she devoured me
And I inside 'and your skin
I buried me
My God, how rich, baby
Your body takes over me
Trembling in an orgasm for me
Real until death, baby


She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar
She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed
And that's why he is going to rumbar

Uah-Uah, h
Mere tell me Romeo
The untouchables, the Illuminatis
The remix more son of the great whore
I am with the King, do you baby?
Baby
Real until death

And I just want a baby with the right one

'Cause I could never be the one to hide one

So it took a year for me to find out

I'm tired of being home alone
I used to have a girl a day
But I want you to stay
You said you might be into girls
Said you're going through a phase
Keeping your heart safe
Well, baby, you can bring a friend
She can ride on top your face
While I fuck you straight

And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out


I can't lose you, babe

If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick


I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real


I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real


Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real"

Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? 
Getting they plays from machines? 
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem 
I never say anything , everybody got they thing 
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes 
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it a lot, I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

How much money you got? 
How many problems you got? 
How many people done doubted you? 
Left you out to rot? 
How many pray that you flop? 
How many lawyers you got? 
How many times you got shot? 
How many niggas you shot? 
How many times did you ride? 
How many niggas done died? 
How many times did you cheat? 
How many times did you lie? 
How many times did she leave? 
How many times did she cry? 
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots

Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby

My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise


I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That’s the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is


I love it when we make up 
Go ’head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 


Let me stay in my bag ’cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it’s a match
Attitude, dream of mine 
When you say that I'm right 
And I find that it works every time


And I love it when we make up 

Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

I love it when we make up 

Go 'head, ruin my makeup 


Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh no, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

The Real Rondón
With that guy you always' tas sad, sad

You fell in love and took it as a joke, you have not you gave yourself
That damage, ma ', you yourself did
I am always waiting for you
I don't know what you are 'thinking
Return, that the time 'tan passing
Time is running out
But, then, then 'go flying
You do not deserve to you 'that they fail you
He does not do it as me and that e 'the detail
Tell me that you want 'to guaye you
Calla'o, who doesn't find anyone
You don't know 'how much I adore you
You ere 'my princess, mommy, you ere' my treasure
If he doesn't value you, mommy, I can, I value you
Because I always want to find the four hand '' and gold


Your devil
You ere 'my kilo and I am your Pablo
And you get you 'when I talk to you
And I put you in four, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH
My Demonia
Can you 'or do you'?You 'erroneous
Diabolical, wears black, Gothic, uah, uah
A DIABLA IN WOMAN
And I lambe to 'lo' tattoo 'in my skin
Drinking codeine
And your buttock 'are my heroine, uah
Baby, you ere 'a devil
And you have 'face that you like being unfaithful
And I love you in my bed
And you want to 'betray my wife


Baby, you know 'that with me you are doing'

Mommy, don't leave me alone
'Toy addicted with that body of Colombia
That booty gives dementia, you ere 'bad influence
Why did they make you my preference?
I send your surgeon greeting '
It does not fail, when I undressed you, I was mute
Of to 'those who threw you' I was the only one who could
Tell him that I am the one who often gives you
I love when you vent on me dancing
How do you look at me when I'm giving you



I love that 'buttock', I confess it
Thanks to Dio 'that you do not hear what I think
With me and 'a passage without return
And I'm going to kidnap you, even if tomorrow he falls prisoner
And send it to fly
E 'a moron who did not know how to value you
Don't say no, because it can juque you
What I have here has' to try, Yeh-eh
He speaks a lot and doesn't know how to get wet
There is' lack of affection, I know only to look at you
What needs 'e' a man who knows how to touch you
I do not border on, I let the AP highlight
With me he has no 'to lie
In bed you don't have to pretend you're fine
Do not take 'fight with the type
If you fight, send it to the fuck and tell me that you are doing '

Because he doesn't make you smile
Baby, I hate when you are doing '
But for your buttock I love seeing you
My devil, today with me you are doing '
Because he doesn't even come to you
Baby, I hate when you are doing '
But for your buttock I love seeing you

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go  like the Dobermann said
I still think the  would go over your head 
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'

Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it

Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state  'cause I had a bag to make
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way


We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane"

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...


Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Nah, what wants 'e' fuck
But he is not going to be able
I am going to see another and you are going to bite


What do you want to call me at this time?
I know that attitude now
You know what to do very well to wrap me
But this time is too late

You try to do everything for me to come back
Things are not the same, why insist?
Avoid discomfort and your time do not lose
With me you can't find anything

Investigating my profile
Don't deny it, I know you

Everything you did with me
He wants to repeat it
Look for more
And that does not matter

Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid

Ayy, ayy

I can still remember  tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it , became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell  if I'd prevail 
And all I did was  put nine-inch nails 
In my eyelids now 
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if, ands, or buts are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said


It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?

And with her I got tangled


I was on the album perreating
I was on the album perreating
I was on the album perreating
I was on the album perreating

Of the way he looked at me
I could notice that she had what she was looking for on the album
I wanted me to dance
And the DJ that music never lowered it
And it is turned on in fire
That does not fall in love, she is for play
Go alone, never lowers your ego
I cause me and facilitate
And is that it is turned on in fire
That does not fall in love, she is for play
Go alone, never lowers your ego
I provoke and facilitate it and it is that


I have an alcohol problem
I don't know why I'm so
For me that the doctor was drinking
The day I was born
Baby, put your hand on the floor
And play with your hair
Your body is pure poison
Baby, you take me 'to heaven
You let me fall, but she lifted me
Leave me, little woman, but she lifted me

You won me
You put me in your game and you damaged me
The weekly ticket may be that it spends it in you
I think bichote throwing the 'weight'
By 'tar ricota I give you kick' and cheese
But we fight, never return and that's why
I want to go pa 'house, but you don't leave me
That ass and 'a threat, I already believe that I am' my partner
A Shot, Dos Shot ', the problem began
Because alcohol got into my system
Who goes chotear already carries the complaint
Don't make me the blame, make her to her

With you I got tangled up
And with a couple of drinks, baby, I released
I stayed with you and I didn't answer
I don't know why I failed
But I do know how rich I passed it
Midnight arrived
Apena 'The touch began
Is that my boyfriend was waiting for me
Before they were twelve
How good the balacor 'last night
I know I failed and forgive me
And if I see it tomorrow
I will say that he does not know me


J Balvin, Man
I was on the album perreating
When with her I wrapped me, yes
My wife was calling me
And I had to give him a delete, and
And I don't let myself wrap

And even the most holy wants to be unfaithful

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me


It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen 
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen 
Got no patience no more , been waitin' too long 
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch 
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake 
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe 
Remember when you got my ass arrested 
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in 
Ooh, I surrender , time to forget ya 
I'm too tired to forgive ya , it's too hard on my liver 
And you know  it’s all  over now
All your friends , you know  they sold you out

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah 


It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights 
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight 
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice 
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy 
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying 
From your passport, it looks like you lying 
You broken down by your past, don't deny it 
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah 
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying 
I did everything to reach out to you 
Said you never had me caught up in no drama 
I done ran into my karma 


Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though


Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me

We were on the low, but you were getting high with me

When it's past 11, that's a different side I see

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me"

If you see it, how does the belt release

Mommy, what he wants 'e' fire!


Make me that hot pants
You want 'this does not make you' the crazy
Tsunami notice, 'pending tea
You sleep with me or take you the wave


You have Baby's face, but you are a killa
I like how it moves you ', Mai', I like how hesitates'
Wolf's pair 'They watch you, but you walk with Godzilla
These people looked like Tenni ', you had them line
So, tell me, ma ', tell me, ma', tell me, ma ', what was it?
'We are live, everyone' tá recording you
Trend marks, you have to shine today
Because I rob my show when I give it to you


Soft, that's how I like
Soft, tell me how you want it
Soft,, you asked more ', don't talk more', tell me, aha

You're naughty
You talked a lot, but you have no way out

It no longer has an excuse
Today he came out with her friend said to kill the tusa
Because a man paid him badly
Is hard and abuse
He got tired of being good
Now it is she who uses them
Because a man paid him badly
He is no longer sentimental
He says that for another man he does not cry, no


But if they put the song
It gives you silly depression
Crying starts calling
But he left her in mailbox
Will it be because with another is
Pretending that can be loved?

But I did all this cry for nothing
Now I'm a bad girl
And now you kickin 'and screamin', Big Toddler
Don's Try To Get Your Friends To eat Holla, Holla

Un-a shot pa 'the deep penalty
And continue to spend the case
Another shot pa 'the mind
So that the memory does not carefully
I no longer copy anything
Your ex
The album is going and just wants
But it is confused when it starts drinking


She heals with rumba
And love for the tomb
To 'the man' buzz


But if they put the song

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't


So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know


Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go"

I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops
Whole squad got the juice, send a stain like a flute 
Whole squad goin' up, JACKBOYS on the loose

Yeah, I'm from the North where they robbin' and killin' 
Young nigga rich, but I'm still from the trenches 
Luxury Tax, my water by G
P-I-R-U, bitch, I bang what I bleed
I'm passin' out pills, I'ma geek up the VIP 
One shot to the head and make sure he don't miss
I fuck on the bitch, have her stalkin' on Fifth
Still pourin' up Act', they say it don't exist 
Fifth got some vibes at the crib
Like, I wanna fuck right now
Keep hundred on hundreds for real
Bitch, I'm goin' up right now
Bitch rollin' some weed, you know gang in the stu'
Bottles on bottles, 1942
Models on models, this shit nothin' new
You might catch some shots takin' shots at the crew
I like my hoes by the two
Blew 800K on a coupe 
We fucked, it wasn't nothin' else to do 
You play with La Flame, I'ma shoot 
This a hundred round drum, I got mob ties
This a double M truck, ain't no broke vibes
Now we only take jets for the hard times
Know I call up them killers, they gon' slide
Bitch, I'm with the gang

I'm with the gang, gang, gang, gang, BOYS hoppin' out of coupes 
I'm switching' lanes tryna maintain, duckin' boys in the blue 
I see you holdin' out on my change, I'm needin' all of the loot 
When I'm ridin' off on my side, best believe I got the scoop 
I could make a hundred right now, give it all to the troops

Damn near caught a felony
One thing I know, two just wanna ride 
I did it outside 
I, you better go hide 
Put it on her feet and I glide
Step with the three like Clyde, slide, slide
We rock the cream on the pie-ie-ie
But that's my better side 
I can't tell a lie 
This is televised 
You need better guys

I'm only on the beat between 10 and 3
Took you, move you outside to the West
Down Southside by the 'jects
Tell me what a time, what a wreck
Never let it down, never let
Always thought T was a rex
Never thought T was a wreck
Put the ice T on your neck 
When it go cold make you sweat
Never let you go, never 
Never let you go, you the best
But never let it go to your head

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby The
Brain Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier 
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday 
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the


Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster 
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster 
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?

I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded 
That's a lot of shots, huh? 


And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness 
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo

'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out

But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at

But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions

The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope

I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war


And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness 
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore



People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches

Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference


And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope
Was a have-not  'cause my pockets
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke
Through the tall grass, run your ass off
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping Fuck Da Police while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo

I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping

I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do

Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'


But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you


Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

I'll take that if that's all you askin' for

Fifty-five hundred, nigga, that's your range
When I came to the club, make it storm, hurricane
Nigga pull up, think he G.I. Joe
Man, 7.62, turn him G.I. Jane


I said it's up, up, up, uppity 
Moonwalkin' all on the money 
When I moonwalk, my diamonds still sunny 
When I moonwalk, I don't need no twenties
When it come to the drip, not in front of me 
Wearin' Balenciaga on my jacket, my shirt
And my pants, and my socks, and my undies 


Woah, I'm too litty
Yeah, bitch look like Chinese Kitty 
1942 in my section, no Remy 
Took JT out the city 
I can make a ho get way too sticky

Hold up, don't you got a whole situation? 
Livin' my life, too risky 
How you doin', Uzi? I'm doin' great
I pulled up in the foreign, let's race 
Yes, I stay with some money on me 
Only thing in my pocket, big face 
It's amazing to me how my baby pull up with a fat ass and a skinny waist
It's amazing to me how I spend all this money and I ain't even go in my safe 
It's amazing to me how these niggas don't know me but still find a way just to hate 
It's amazing to me how back then she ain't want me but now she wanna go on a date 
It's amazing to me how she ask for them racks, told that girl get the fuck out my face 
It's amazing to me how I'm eatin' so much and I still didn't gain no weight 

Yeah, chopstick came with a large lo mein
Extra clip in it, nigga, I ain't got no aim
I said, Balmain pocket filled with fresh romaine

Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls 
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat? 
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo

In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn 
Spending money at the club like Sam's

Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram 
I can't switch on the fam 
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan 
This where my head is 
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings 
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections 
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section 
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested

I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin'

It is seen that ere 'de la' that janguea weekly
You know 'my flow, my life and' a movie
He says it is natural, but for me that the booty was made
The boyfriend or that is surfer while 'he is in the buggy
I on top of her giving table, ma ', you ere' my blonde
You ere 'mine and's now, I'm going to get married as Nicky Jam
Who am I always want to investigate
I take a billion and change the identity

JUANKA
Livesto 'of the hybrid
He has a daring face, but without alcohol he is shy
And as if na 'he sticks and shows his habilida'
And leaves them Chocá 'like the gloves' of Trinidad
Uh, and none arrives
It never refuses, it does not take off
The block gives it to me
She is not to lose, she got used to winning
I try to fall, but you ere 'the end and get tangled up
But proceed;What he asks for 'mommy, I grant you
Complete made in Cali, shoe 'Roberto Cavalli
He doesn't like Molly or Pali
And I know that perhaps or maybe they rise from tre '
I threw and connected, my diamond shines'
And you like that and runs, smoking until your mind is erased, uh

Snathea, turning in the jeepeta
I have a blonde who has a big blonde 'the tit'
Wants me to put it in
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta
With me a blonde, he has big 'the tit'
Wants me to put it in
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta

Was a lost cause with some lost love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us
Then I found her
My whole world turned upside down, uh
But for the better


I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, Lord, help me, I've been lonely
That's when you accept me, then you set me free


Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it

Thank God I finally found you
You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't wanna be here alone
And I thank God I finally found you
I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't let me be here alone"

Sensual politics

Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt

Under someone's bed

I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'


'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me


Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight"

Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me

Cross your heart, won't tell no other

Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long


And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater

Cutting me open, then healing me fine

Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you


Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven

Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
Just because you mine, I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
I hope you ain't against the slow grind
 Me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo thang
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin 
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B

Shorty a lil' baddieShe my lil' boo thing
And shorty got the fatty 
Shorty be catching mood swings
Every time I fuck without a rubber
I nutted on her covers
And I kept it undercover
'Cause I don't kiss and tell"

Hawai on vacation, my congratulations
Very nice on Instagram what you post
For me to see how it is doing good, but you do bad
Because love is not bought with na '

Like all your follower '
Tell him that the time 'are now improves'
I don't think when I call you ignore me
If after me there will be no more love
You and I fuimo 'one
I did it 'A fast' before breakfast
Fumábamo 'La Hookah and the smoke passed you
And now in this war he doesn't win any
If you ask me, nobody is blamed
A VECE 'problems are gathered
Let me talk, please, don't interrupt me
If I did something bad, then disculp me
People will believe you, you act well that role
Baby, but you're not happy with him

Latino Gang
Yesterday I saw her perreando alone
It looks more 'beautiful
Now that is not with that man
That happiness as clothes is removed


That I was always when you weren't '
It was so much pain that I no longer killed me
Little by little I didn't need you
And I smiled at me 'enrolled
And you
Saying that it was lack of attitude
But in this relationship I made more than you, Yeh
And in a state I sent you to say that


Now everything changed, it touches her
Mari and a bottle
Grace 'to abuse became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you
Now everything changed, it touches her
Party and a bottle
Grace 'to abuse became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you

Now he wants me to record it
Hesitating and teaching it
He no longer likes to continue patrone ', she and' the patron
The little princess was, look for Fiona, because
To 'the fine' are from Party in Party
Keep killing the 'with bottle and mari
They left you a state there, there, there
Says still throwing me and I don't fall there, there
I failed the contract, I put what was missing
She likes abuse, but not the one you gave her '
The Apple tells him, his iPhone, his IPA ',
IPA 'Drink, IPA' Smoking, IPA 'Fuck, what?
To 'the fine' are from Party in Party
Keep killing the 'with bottle and mari
They left you a state there, there, there
I dedicate to you, he said like this:


Has you 'believed that I was going to cry?
You take it 'clear that I was waiting for you'
You thought you had me '
But you never had me, I'm the Rosalia
If I carry so much 'chain' not e 'pa' that nobody loves me
It does not let anyone heart
You 'tá playing with the player
The one that steps strongly, the kill

Now everything changed, it touches her
Mari and a bottle
Grace 'to abuse became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you
And now everything changed, it touches her
Mari and a bottle
Thanks to the abuse it became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you


It all started with the WhatsApp block
No matter how much you call it either will you not answer
Now she is just rumba and you collapse
You cry because your tears did not value
Even your mother says you didn't take care of her
His heart hates you for how bad you treated her
And if you see you on the street, you will surely get the de'o
You took her from asshole, now you are her asshole
You fell very low, at the drunk party
It deserves' in your life everything 'the chores'
And I know that you are 'badly injured
In life to 'it is paid because you were a spoiled


Everything changed, took a 360 ° turn
He got more 'rich and is put for the return
He doesn't want to know about you, burning pa 'the sale
The fuck, Brother, calm, passed you the account
And now Rollin is breaking the street
He got tired, he doesn't want a choir with anyone
He took pleasure and there is no one who stopped it
And now it is difficult again that jale

Now she wants road
And now more than now it is single
Drink and smoke the whole night
And gives it tremendous loquera
When the drunkenness takes
It gives them to hear safaera
And the beautiful
But it is not given to anyone
PRI-YAH-YAH-YAH-YAH, FARRU!


Now everything changed, it touches her
Mari and a bottle
Grace 'to abuse became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you
Now everything changed, it touches her
Hookah and a bottle
Grace 'to abuse became beautiful
Now you want it 'and she doesn't love you

I've been telling him for a while
That something better deserves
LOSING YOUR TIME FOLLOWS
Knowing that it does not belong to me
And since I met her
He leaves with her friend for the album
But when the note uploads it always returns to me
He tells me: my life, I know what I have to leave what you do your follies


You my madness, baby
Hours spend and more ask me for more
Do not get tired, it seems to have no end
Ours is crazy
You my madness, baby
Hours spend and more ask me for more
Do not get tired, it seems to have no end

Crazy
I love when I do it 'in the acura
Before 'arriving with the photo to torture me
He goes crazy if I squeeze his waist
She and 'my baby
It spends to'a the squeech night 'with me
No one suspects because not even for the rede
Only somo 'friend'
Like Piqué and Shakira, I take care of her in my bed
My baby
It spends to'a the squeech night 'with me
No one suspects because not even for the rede
Only somo 'friend'
Like Piqué and Shakira, I take care of her in my bed

Hours spend and more ask me for more
Do not get tired, it seems to have no end
Ours is crazy
You my madness, baby
Hours spend and more ask me for more
Do not get tired, it seems to have no end
Ours is crazy

Whenever I listen to a song that reminds me of you
Or a daring photo that comes to me
I am activated by desire, I want to you
And I call you because I know there is never a lock
You tell me that ours is Eternity
Because devouring us has turned your fatality
In five letters I am the one who penetrates you
I corleone when it does it e 'High Quality
You get insanity because I'm your weak
In privacy, the 'e' a reality
I do 'with your life what I want' and I allowed it
But you call me 'Or I call you and fall out there


Tell me what is your purpose
See your videos how Ester Expósito
You have me well crazy
I do not understand what the problem is
If we like it so much, what is the dilemma?
I'm tempted to touch you, tempted to sin
For me I kidnap you and you don't go from here
But if he returns to me
He tells me: my life, I know that I have to let you do your follies
Tempted to touch you, tempted to sin
For me I kidnap you and you don't go from here

He tells me: my life, I know that I have to let you do your follies

You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds untrue to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it 
I swear to God , I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it 
I swear to God , I never fall in love 
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it 


You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah

I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah"

You fuck with the ones that fuck with you, what?
The niggas—, the bi—, the dumb-ass bitches wanna come up and lay up and give you pussy at, what?
Twelve? One o'clock at night? Face-ass nigga, do I look dumb, stupid or slow?
Nigga, please, what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Just like you wanna stick a dick up in me, I want some motherfuckin' money
And don't get in your motherfuckin' feelings when you see me in the motherfuckin' club randomly
And one of your niggas wanna get down on me
And I wanna give them some pussy 'cause they gave me some money
Know what I mean? It's easy"

I didn't want to accept it, no
But the earth and you have something similar
You put me on the floor, oh
Although I didn't believe you could affect me
You did not put in water to'a the rose 'that I gave you
They dried, look like you
My blue sky you put it gray
I hope and don't do what you did to me


Gózala
That life is one, mommy, gózala
Look that this world turns a thousand
I hope you don't get to my door because I will not open you
But, baby, gózala
That life is one, mommy, gózala
Look that this world turns a thousand
I hope you don't get to my door because I will not open you
But, baby

Parce, you left me alone
And now I'm in love
Of the buttock 'of that chimbitita
Angel face, but damn


Everything was your fault, you got daughter 'and whore
You got half actress
I didn't know he was' cunning, drool
Everything was your fault, you got daughter 'and whore

Look that this world turns a thousand
I hope and don't go back to my door because I will not open you
But, baby, gózala


Because I'm going to enjoy
Improve 'cat' that I am going to fuck
One that loves me and that is loyal to me
Not like you, that does not work, 'you knew how to turn
I released you in band and now my life and 'a parranda
You ere 'do' color 'like a panda
Now come, come a bongazo
No longer e 'for love that the chest takes the singing'

Gózala
That life is one, mommy, gózala
Look that this world turns a thousand
I hope you don't get to my door because I will not open you
But, baby, gózala
That life is one, mommy, gózala
Look that this world turns a thousand
I hope you don't get to my door because I will not open you


They no longer open glass in the presidential suite, no
No one that tilts you in front of the sea
And I started shouting as a shipwrecked lost in the sea
That 'moment' no longer happens


Everything was your fault, you got hijueputa
You got half actress
I didn't know it was' cunning
Everything was your fault, you got hijueputa
You got half actress
I didn't know it was' cunning


I didn't want to accept it, no

The end of the day
Someone Come and Save Me, please
Sighs of a tired day
I guess everyone is happy
Can you look at me?'CAUSE I am Blue and Grey
The meaning of tears reflected in the mirror
My colored blue and grey hidden in laughter


I don't know where it went wrong
I'm a blue question mark in my head since I was young
So I don't know how I lived fiercely
Looking back on the but here
Those shadows that swallow me
Still, the blue question mark
Is it anxious or depressed
How is it really regret animal
Or is it my loneliness
I still don't know
I hope it will not be encroached.


I Just Wanna be Happyer
Melt me on a cold day
My hand
Colorless echo
Oh this ground Feels So Heavier
I am singing by myself
I Just Wanna be Happyer
Is this too much greedy

I felt when I walked on a cold winter street
Breathing of the faster heart
I still feel it
Don't say it's okay
Because it's not okay
Please don't leave it alone


Always walking and always receiving light
But today, somehow strange scenes
Is it dull or broken?
But it's heavy
Appearing gray rhino
Without focus, I'm standing
It's not like this moment
It's not just scary
I don't believe the confidence
Words like colors are tickling
The wide gray area is comfortable
Hundreds of millions of expressions Grey
My world when it rains
Dance on this city
On a clear day, the fog
Always together on wet days
All dust here
Cost

I Just Wanna be Happyer
Feel my hands
It's not warm, so you need more
Oh this ground Feels So Heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future
I was going to say


After secretly picking up words in the air
Now I'm sleeping at dawn Good Night"

Left here without you , without you

Without you , without you

Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you"

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house

Hey how what says


She didn't

He says he has no owner
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, ah

The same thing does with it '
And she didn't
Told that he has no dumane
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, woh

The same thing does with it '


Never think 'or what about you because she is part of the game
This and 'a eat and go, my love, we vemo' after
In women I do not trust, any I beg
He is making you look bad, Manito;that you, ring
Compa, I know that I see a battery.
But with what you release, 'he doesn't give him a purchase'
She looks for someone to sponsor
There is no leather that suffocates me
In the background, they are not like on the surface
I warned you that if I was going to post it, not the taguera '
I had suspicion ', but I didn't know it was so bad
Now she has a better new friend, one tamara
When they ignore your call ', they laugh out loud'
Hey, get him if he wants ', but, he does not do it' public
Bastard, do you think 'what you are going to be the only one?
What e 'what you want'?What in the corner do you tell you the vein?
Even in car of another 'man' has you stop you, yai

I am not yours, I sell you sleep
Know 'I have no owner
When I'm with you, and 'the most beautiful
The same thing does with it '
And she didn't
He says he has no owner
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, woh
The same thing does with it '


Child, how much 'I see' I have it 'e repeti'?
I am not anyone's woman, so calm the frenzy
I happily told you
So shut up already your mouth and stop talking about me
An appointment with you?
If you want ', call me and I'm
But don't taguee 'please
I don't have time for your hypnotic historite
It happens to fuck him that gives him follow
He wants something serious, I want to play
Want 'or don't want', I have you in my hand '
Devil, you 'tá crazy, engualicha'o
Of my vicia'o body, you can't get out of that
'Tá looking for a way out, it was lost in the excess'

I am not yours, I sell you sleep
Know 'I have no owner
When I'm with you, and 'the most beautiful
The same thing I do with it '
She didn't
He says he has no owner
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, woh
The same thing does with it '


Partner, I tried, but you can't
He 'paying something, you have to leave it, and that e' that he must
Already at the level that one 'tá, to burn with a Leather?
If the fair does not circulate, I go folds and moves
Are I a continued?The one that has more 'cousin'?
No E 'de Boca, Tiguerone' Hemo 'passed through the same
In feeling, one lets a leather give you love
That woman used you, she sold you sleep like a ñiño
When I see that system, in Realida 'I even like
Your 'street' number is attacked 'like a brush
They made you a cuica, barbarian, with Photosho '
Go to trial thoroughly and you will see ', that was triggered
Mono, he was warned, but the 'chrome' was frightened
The fear of mine and 'to kill her, there the return e' a fool
I used you to you, but everything was a
Not even so took it, it was freezing and wants to be a gang

She didn't

He says he has no owner
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, ah

The same thing does with it '
And she didn't
He says he has no owner
And when he is with you, that is the most beautiful, woh

The same thing does with it '

On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. 

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'


Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel

Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers

Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live

I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore

For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me

Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again

Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj

Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres

And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin 
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother 
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati 
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body 
Mansory, kitted out with every option 
Lemme know if that's a problem 
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it

Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation

Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?

Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real 

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure"

And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me


Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on


Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes


It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality


Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on


Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes


You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreaming, lucid
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me?
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me
How you figure out how to call me from the TV?
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it


Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best
Best you ever had and best you gon' get
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes


Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes


Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah"
