"Blues rock","Blues rock is a fusion genre and form of rock music that relies on the chords/scales and instrumental improvisation of blues.[3][4] It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock (electric guitar, electric bass guitar, and drums, sometimes with keyboards and harmonica). From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal.

Blues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric Chicago blues songs, such as those by Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, and Jimmy Reed, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who put several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents. Some of these bands also played long, involved improvisations as were then commonplace on jazz records.[5] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the style became more hard rock-oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the early Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend, along with Led Zeppelin, Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, and Foghat in the UK.

In the 1980s, more traditional blues styles influenced blues rock, which continues into the 2000s, with more of a return to basics.[citation needed] Along with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on album-oriented rock radio in the United States, and later the classic rock format established there during the 1980s.[6]

Blues rock can be characterized by bluesy improvisation, extended boogie jams typically focused on electric guitar solos, and often a heavier, riff-oriented sound and feel to the songs than found in typical Chicago-style blues. Blues rock bands ""borrow[ed] the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock & roll"".[5] It is also often played at a fast tempo, again distinguishing it from the blues.[5]

Blues rock songs often follow typical blues structures, such as twelve-bar blues, sixteen-bar blues, etc. They also use the I-IV-V progression, though there are exceptions, some pieces having a ""B"" section, while others remain on the I. The Allman Brothers Band's version of ""Stormy Monday"", which uses chord substitutions based on Bobby ""Blue"" Bland's 1961 rendition, adds a solo section where ""the rhythm shifts effortlessly into an uptempo 6/8-time jazz feel"".[7] The key is usually major, but can also be minor, such as in ""Black Magic Woman"".

One notable difference is the frequent use of a straight eighth-note or rock rhythm instead of triplets usually found in blues. An example is Cream's ""Crossroads"". Although it was adapted from Robert Johnson's ""Cross Road Blues"", the bass ""combines with drums to create and continually emphasize continuity in the regular metric drive"".[8]

Rock music uses driving rhythms and electric guitar techniques such as distortion and power chords already used by 1950s electric blues guitarists, particularly Memphis bluesmen such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare.[9][10] Characteristics that blues rock adopted from electric blues include its dense texture, basic blues band instrumentation,[11] rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances.[12] Precursors to blues rock included the Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Albert King, and Freddie King, who began incorporating rock and roll elements into their blues music during the late 1950s to early 1960s.[13][14][15]

1963 marked the appearance of American rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack, whose idiosyncratic, fast-paced electric blues guitar style[16] came to be identified with the advent of blues rock as a distinct genre. His instrumentals from that period were recognizable as blues or rhythm and blues tunes, but he relied heavily upon fast-picking techniques derived from traditional American country and bluegrass genres. The best-known of these are the 1963 Billboard hit singles ""Memphis"" and ""Wham!"".[17]  Around the same time, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was formed. Fronted by blues harp player and singer Paul Butterfield, it included two members from Howlin' Wolf's touring band, bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay, and later two electric guitarists, Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop.[18]  In 1965, its debut album, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band was released. AllMusic's Michael Erlewine commented, ""Used to hearing blues covered by groups like the Rolling Stones, that first album had an enormous impact on young (and primarily White) rock players.""[17] The second album East West (1966) introduced extended soloing – the 13 minute instrumental title track included jazz and Indian raga influences – that served as a model for psychedelic and acid rock.[17]  In 1965, avid blues collectors Bob Hite and Alan Wilson formed Canned Heat.  Their early recordings focused heavily on electric versions of Delta blues songs, but soon began exploring long musical improvisations (""jams"") built around John Lee Hooker songs.[17] Other popular mid-1960s groups, such as the Doors and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, also adapted songs by blues artists to include elements of rock.  Butterfield, Canned Heat, and Joplin performed at the Monterey (1967) and Woodstock (1969) festivals.

In the UK, several musicians honed their skills in a handful of British blues bands, primarily those of Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner.[19] While the early British rhythm and blues groups, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, incorporated American R&B, rock and roll, and pop, John Mayall took a more distinctly electric blues approach.[19] In 1966, he released Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, the first of several influential blues rock albums.[20] When Eric Clapton left Mayall to form Cream, they created a hybrid style with blues, rock, and jazz improvisation, which was the most innovative to date.[21] British band Fleetwood Mac initially played traditionally-oriented electric blues, but soon evolved.[22]  Their guitarist Peter Green, who was Clapton's replacement with Mayall, brought many innovations to their music.[23]Chicken Shack,[24] early Jethro Tull, Keef Hartley Band and  Climax Blues Band recorded blues rock songs.

The electric guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix (a veteran of many American rhythm and blues and soul groups from the early-mid-1960s) and his power trios, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, had a broad and lasting influence on the development of blues rock, especially for guitarists. Clapton continued to explore several musical styles and contributed to bringing blues rock into the mainstream.[19]  In the late 1960s, Jeff Beck, with his band the Jeff Beck Group, developed blues rock into a form of heavy rock.[19]Jimmy Page, who replaced Beck in the Yardbirds, followed suit with Led Zeppelin[19] and became a major force in the 1970s heavy metal scene. Other blues rock musicians in the 1970s include Dr. Feelgood, Rory Gallagher and Robin Trower.

Beginning in the early 1970s, American bands such as Aerosmith fused blues with a hard rock edge. Blues rock grew to include Southern rock bands, like the Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd, while the British scene, except for the advent of groups such as Status Quo and Foghat, became focused on heavy metal innovation.[25]

While blues rock and hard rock shared many similarities in the early 1970s, more traditional blues styles influenced blues rock in the 1980s,[5] when the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Georgia Satellites and Robert Cray recorded their best-known works, and the 1990s, which saw guitarists Gary Moore, Jeff Healey, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd become popular concert attractions. Female blues singers such as Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, Sue Foley, Joanne Shaw Taylor and Shannon Curfman recorded blues rock albums. Groups such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and the White Stripes brought an edgier, more diverse style into the 2000s, while the Black Keys returned to basics.[citation needed]Gary Clark Jr., known for his fusing of blues, rock and soul, has been classified as a blues rock artist,[26] with Rolling Stone's Jonathan Bernstein referring to Clark's albums Blak and Blu (2012) and The Story of Sonny Boy Slim (2015) as ""steeped in a sleek, modern blues-rock production style"".[27]"
"Jump blues","Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, jazz, and boogie woogie usually played by small groups and featuring horn instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll.[2] Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival.

Jump blues evolved from the music of big bands such as those of Lionel Hampton and Lucky Millinder in the early 1940s which produced musicians such as Louis Jordan, Jack McVea, Earl Bostic, and Arnett Cobb.[3] Jordan was the most popular of the jump blues stars; other artists who played the genre include Roy Brown, Amos Milburn, and Joe Liggins, as well as sax soloists Jack McVea, Big Jay McNeely, and Bull Moose Jackson. Hits included singles such as Jordan's ""Saturday Night Fish Fry"", Roy Brown's ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" and Big Jay McNeely's ""Deacon's Hop"".[4]

One important stylistic prototype in the development of R&B was jump blues, pioneered by Louis Jordan, with ... His Tympany Five ... three horns and a rhythm section, while stylistically his music melded elements of swing and blues, incorporating the shuffle rhythm, boogie-woogie bass lines, and short horn patterns or riffs. The songs featured the use of African American vernacular language, humor, and vocal call-and-response sections between Jordan and the band. Jordan’s music appealed to both African American and white audiences, and he had broad success with hit songs like ""Is You Is or Is You Ain’t My Baby"" (1944).[5]

Blues and jazz were part of the same musical world, with many musicians straddling both genres.[6] Jump bands such as the Tympany Five, which came into being at the same time as the boogie-woogie revival, achieved maximum effect with an eight-to-the-bar boogie-woogie style.[7]

Jordan's ""raucous recordings"" with the Tympany Five like ""Saturday Night Fish Fry"", one of the first to feature a distorted electric guitar,[8] ""literally made its listeners jump to its pulsing beat"".[9] At least two other Jordan records are viewed as jump blues, Caldonia and Choo Choo Ch'Boogie.[10]

Jordan's jump blues combined good-natured novelty lyrics (some with suggestive double meanings); pushing the tempo; strengthening the beat; layering the sound with his bluesy saxophone and playful melodies.[11]

Lionel Hampton recorded the stomping big-band blues song ""Flying Home"" in 1942.[2] Featuring a choked, screaming tenor sax  performance by Illinois Jacquet, the song was a hit in the ""race"" category.[12][4]Billboard described ""Flying Home"" as ""an unusually swingy side...with a bright bounce in the medium tempo and a steady drive maintained, it's a jumper that defies standing still"".

Both Hampton and Jordan combined the popular boogie-woogie rhythm, a grittier version of swing-era saxophone styles as exemplified by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, and playful, humorous lyrics or verbal asides laced with jive talk.[12]

As this urban, jazz-based music became more popular, musicians who wanted to ""play for the people"" began favoring a heavy, insistent beat. which appealed to black listeners who no longer wished to be identified with ""life down home"".[13]

Jump groups, employed to play for jitterbug dances at a much lower cost than big bands, became popular with agents and ballroom owners. The saxophonist Art Chaney said ""[w]e were insulted when an audience wouldn't dance"".[7]

Jump was especially popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s, through artists such as Louis Jordan, Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Charles Brown, Helen Humes, T-Bone Walker, Roy Milton, Billy Wright, Wynonie Harris, Louis Prima, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.[2][14] Less frequently mentioned, Goree Carter also recorded some jump blues; his Rock Awhile is said by Robert Palmer to be an appropriate candidate for the title of first rock and roll record.[15]

By the mid-1950s, jump blues had been all but forgotten, with a few exceptions such as 
""Five Guys Named Moe"" and some songs from the 1980s, by The Honeydrippers.[16]

The term ""rock and roll"" had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&B, but by the time DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll in the mid 50s, ""the sexual component had been dialled down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing"".[17]"
"Rhythm and blues","

Rhythm and blues, frequently abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated within African-American communities in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when ""rocking, jazz based music ... [with a] heavy, insistent beat"" was becoming more popular.
In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations.

The term ""rhythm and blues"" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term ""R&B"" became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. From 1960s to 70s, some British groups were referred to and promoted as being R&B bands. By the 1970s, the term ""rhythm and blues"" had changed once again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk.

In the late 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as ""contemporary R&B"". This contemporary form combines rhythm and blues with various elements of pop, soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic music.

Although Jerry Wexler of Billboard magazine is credited with coining the term ""rhythm and blues"" as a musical term in the United States in 1948,[3] the term had been used in Billboard as early as 1943.[4][5] However, the company's first list of songs popular among African Americans was named Harlem Hit Parade; created in 1942, it listed the ""most popular records in Harlem,"" and is the predecessor to the Billboard RnB chart.[6] “Rhythm and Blues” replaced the common term ""race music"", a term coined by Okeh producer Ralph Peer based on the common self description by the African American press as “people of race.”[7][8] The term ""rhythm and blues"" was then used by Billboard in its chart listings from June 1949 until August 1969, when its ""Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles"" chart was renamed as ""Best Selling Soul Singles"".[9]
Before the ""Rhythm and Blues"" name was instated, various record companies had already begun replacing the term ""race music"" with the term ""sepia series"".[10] ""Rhythm and blues"" is often abbreviated as ""R&B"" or ""R'n'B"".[11]

In the early 1950s, the term ""rhythm & blues"" was frequently applied to blues records.[12] Writer and producer Robert Palmer defined rhythm & blues as ""a catchall term referring to any music that was made by and for black Americans"".[13] He has also used the term ""R&B"" as a synonym for jump blues.[14] However, AllMusic separates it from jump blues because of R&B's stronger gospel influences.[15]Lawrence Cohn, author of Nothing but the Blues, writes that ""rhythm and blues"" was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience. According to him, the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music, unless a gospel song sold enough to break into the charts.[7]  Well into the 21st century, the term R&B continues in use (in some contexts) to categorize music made by black musicians, as distinct from styles of music made by other musicians.

In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, and saxophone. Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.[16] R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy,[17][page needed] as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, economics, and aspirations.[citation needed]

One publication of the Smithsonian Institution provided this summary of the origins of the genre in 2016.

""A distinctly African American music drawing from the deep tributaries of African American expressive culture, it is an amalgam of jump blues, big band swing, gospel, boogie, and blues that was initially developed during a thirty-year period that bridges the era of legally sanctioned racial segregation, international conflicts, and the struggle for civil rights"".[2]

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame defines some of the originators of R&B, including Joe Turner's big band, Louis Jordan's Tympany Five, James Brown and LaVern Baker. In fact, this source states that ""Louis Jordan joined Turner in laying the foundation for R&B in the 1940s, cutting one swinging rhythm & blues masterpiece after another"". Other artists who were ""cornerstones of R&B and its transformation into rock & roll"" include Etta James, Fats Domino, Roy Brown, Little Richard and Ruth Brown. The ""doo wop"" groups were also noteworthy, including the Orioles, the Ravens and the Dominoes.[18]

The term ""rock and roll"" had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&B, but when DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll on mainstream radio in the mid-1950s, ""the sexual component had been dialed down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing"".[19]

The great migration of Black Americans to the urban industrial centers of Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the 1920s and 1930s created a new market for jazz, blues, and related genres of music. These genres of music were often performed by full-time musicians, either working alone or in small groups. The precursors of rhythm and blues came from jazz and blues, which overlapped in the late-1920s and 30s through the work of musicians such as the Harlem Hamfats, with their 1936 hit ""Oh Red"", as well as Lonnie Johnson, Leroy Carr, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and T-Bone Walker. There was also increasing emphasis on the electric guitar as a lead instrument, as well as the piano and saxophone.[20]

R&B originated in African-American communities in the 1940s.[21] In 1948, RCA Victor was marketing black music under the name ""Blues and Rhythm"". In that year, Louis Jordan dominated the top five listings of the R&B charts with three songs, and two of the top five songs were based on the boogie-woogie rhythms that had come to prominence during the 1940s.[22] Jordan's band, the Tympany Five (formed in 1938), consisted of him on saxophone and vocals, along with musicians on trumpet, tenor saxophone, piano, bass and drums.[23][24] Lawrence Cohn described the music as ""grittier than his boogie-era jazz-tinged blues"".[7]: 173  Robert Palmer described it as ""urbane, rocking, jazz-based music ... [with a] heavy, insistent beat"".[25] Jordan's music, along with that of Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Billy Wright, and Wynonie Harris, is now also referred to as jump blues. Already Paul Gayten, Roy Brown, and others had had hits in the style now referred to as rhythm and blues. In 1948, Wynonie Harris's remake of Brown's 1947 recording ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" reached number two on the charts, following band leader Sonny Thompson's ""Long Gone"" at number one.[26][27]

In 1949, the term ""Rhythm and Blues"" (R&B) replaced the Billboard category Harlem Hit Parade.[7] Also in that year, ""The Huckle-Buck"", recorded by band leader and saxophonist Paul Williams, was the number one R&B tune, remaining on top of the charts for nearly the entire year. Written by musician and arranger Andy Gibson, the song was described as a ""dirty boogie"" because it was risque and raunchy.[28] Paul Williams and His Hucklebuckers' concerts were sweaty riotous affairs that got shut down on more than one occasion. Their lyrics, by Roy Alfred (who later co-wrote the 1955 hit ""(The) Rock and Roll Waltz""), were mildly sexually suggestive, and one teenager from Philadelphia said ""That Hucklebuck was a very nasty dance"".[29][30] Also in 1949, a new version of a 1920s blues song, ""Ain't Nobody's Business"" was a number four hit for Jimmy Witherspoon, and Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five once again made the top five with ""Saturday Night Fish Fry"".[31] Many of these hit records were issued on new independent record labels, such as Savoy (founded 1942), King (founded 1943), Imperial (founded 1945), Specialty (founded 1946), Chess (founded 1947), and Atlantic (founded 1948).[20]

African American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 1800s with the popularity of the Cuban contradanza (known outside of Cuba as the habanera).[32] The habanera rhythm can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.

For the more than a quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the Cuban genre habanera exerted a constant presence in African American popular music.[33] Jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera rhythm (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz.[34] There are examples of tresillo-like rhythms in some African American folk music such as the hand-clapping and foot-stomping patterns in ring shout, post-Civil War drum and fife music, and New Orleans second line music.[35]Wynton Marsalis considers tresillo to be the New Orleans ""clave"" (although technically, the pattern is only half a clave).[36] Tresillo is the most basic duple-pulse rhythmic cell in Sub-Saharan African music traditions, and its use in African American music is one of the clearest examples of African rhythmic retention in the United States.[37] The use of tresillo was continuously reinforced by the consecutive waves of Cuban music, which were adopted into North American popular culture. In 1940 Bob Zurke released ""Rhumboogie"", a boogie-woogie with a tresillo bass line, and lyrics proudly declaring the adoption of Cuban rhythm:

Harlem's got a new rhythm, man it's burning up the dance floors because it's so hot! They took a little rhumba rhythm and added boogie-woogie and now look what they got! Rhumboogie, it's Harlem's new creation with the Cuban syncopation, it's the killer! Just plant your both feet on each side. Let both your hips and shoulder glide. Then throw your body back and ride. There's nothing like rhumbaoogie, rhumboogie, boogie-woogie. In Harlem or Havana, you can kiss the old Savannah. It's a killer![38]

Although originating in the metropolis at the mouth of the Mississippi River, New Orleans blues, with its Afro-Caribbean rhythmic traits, is distinct from the sound of the Mississippi Delta blues.[39] In the late 1940s, New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to Cuban influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming.[40] The first use of tresillo in R&B occurred in New Orleans. Robert Palmer recalls:

New Orleans producer-bandleader Dave Bartholomew first employed this figure (as a saxophone-section riff) on his own 1949 disc ""Country Boy"" and subsequently helped make it the most over-used rhythmic pattern in 1950s rock 'n' roll. On numerous recordings by Fats Domino, Little Richard and others, Bartholomew assigned this repeating three-note pattern not just to the string bass, but also to electric guitars and even baritone sax, making for a very heavy bottom. He recalls first hearing the figure – as a bass pattern on a Cuban disc.[41]

In a 1988 interview with Palmer, Bartholomew (who had the first R&B studio band),[42] revealed how he initially superimposed tresillo over swing rhythm:

I heard the bass playing that part on a 'rumba' record. On 'Country Boy' I had my bass and drums playing a straight swing rhythm and wrote out that 'rumba' bass part for the saxes to play on top of the swing rhythm. Later, especially after rock 'n' roll came along, I made the 'rumba' bass part heavier and heavier. I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.[43]

Bartholomew referred to the Cuban son by the misnomer rumba, a common practice of that time. Fats Domino's ""Blue Monday"", produced by Bartholomew, is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in R&B. Bartholomew's 1949 tresillo-based ""Oh Cubanas"" is an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music. The word mambo, larger than any of the other text, is placed prominently on the record label. In his composition ""Misery"", New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair plays a habanera-like figure in his left hand.[44] The deft use of triplets is a characteristic of Longhair's style.

Gerhard Kubik notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a ""very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early-twentieth-century African American music ... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African timelines.""[45] In the late 1940s, this changed somewhat when the two-celled timeline structure was brought into the blues. New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as ""Carnival Day"", (Bartholomew 1949) and ""Mardi Gras In New Orleans"" (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.

Robert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and ""fell under the spell of Perez Prado's mambo records.""[46] He was especially enamored with Afro-Cuban music. Michael Campbell states: ""Professor Longhair's influence was ... far-reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is 'Longhair's Blues Rhumba,' where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.""[47] Longhair's particular style was known locally as rumba-boogie.[48] In his ""Mardi Gras in New Orleans"", the pianist employs the 2–3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba boogie ""guajeo"".[49]

The syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Alexander Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from ""New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s,"" adding: ""The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from a triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.[50] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states that this model ""... is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.""[51]

Johnny Otis released the R&B mambo ""Mambo Boogie"" in January 1951, featuring congas, maracas, claves, and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression.[52]Ike Turner recorded ""Cubano Jump"" (1954) an electric guitar instrumental, which is built around several 2–3 clave figures, adopted from the mambo. The Hawketts, in ""Mardi Gras Mambo"" (1955) (featuring the vocals of a young Art Neville), make a clear reference to Perez Prado in their use of his trademark ""Unhh!"" in the break after the introduction.[53]

Ned Sublette states: ""The electric blues cats were very well aware of Latin music, and there was definitely such a thing as rhumba blues; you can hear Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf playing it.""[54] He also cites Otis Rush, Ike Turner and Ray Charles, as R&B artists who employed this feel.[54]

The use of clave in R&B coincided with the growing dominance of the backbeat, and the rising popularity of Cuban music in the U.S. In a sense, clave can be distilled down to tresillo (three-side) answered by the backbeat (two-side).[55]

The ""Bo Diddley beat"" (1955) is perhaps the first true fusion of 3–2 clave and R&B/rock 'n' roll. Bo Diddley has given different accounts of the riff's origins. Sublette asserts: ""In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.""[54]Johnny Otis's ""Willie and the Hand Jive"" (1958) is another example of this successful blend of 3–2 claves and R&B. Otis used the Cuban instruments claves and maracas on the song.

Afro-Cuban music was the conduit by which African American music was ""re-Africanized"", through the adoption of two-celled figures like clave and Afro-Cuban instruments like the conga drum, bongos, maracas and claves. According to John Storm Roberts, R&B became the vehicle for the return of Cuban elements into mass popular music.[56]Ahmet Ertegun, producer for Atlantic Records, is reported to have said that ""Afro-Cuban rhythms added color and excitement to the basic drive of R&B.""[57] As Ned Sublette points out though: ""By the 1960s, with Cuba the object of a United States embargo that still remains in effect today, the island nation had been forgotten as a source of music. By the time people began to talk about rock and roll as having a history, Cuban music had vanished from North American consciousness.""[58]

At first, only African Americans were buying R&B discs. According to Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, sales were localized in African-American markets; there were no white sales or white radio play. During the early 1950s, more white teenagers started to become aware of R&B and began purchasing the music. For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin's of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were to whites. Eventually, white teens across the country turned their musical taste toward rhythm and blues.[59]

Johnny Otis, who had signed with the Newark, New Jersey-based Savoy Records, produced many R&B hits in 1951, including ""Double Crossing Blues"", ""Mistrustin' Blues"" and ""Cupid's Boogie"", all of which hit number one that year. Otis scored ten top ten hits that year. Other hits include ""Gee Baby"", ""Mambo Boogie"" and ""All Nite Long"".[60]The Clovers, a quintet consisting of a vocal quartet with accompanying guitarist, sang a distinctive-sounding combination of blues and gospel.[61] They had the number five hit of the year with ""Don't You Know I Love You"" on Atlantic.[60][62][63] Also in July 1951, Cleveland, Ohio DJ Alan Freed started a late-night radio show called ""The Moondog Rock Roll House Party"" on WJW (850 AM).[64][65] Freed's show was sponsored by Fred Mintz, whose R&B record store had a primarily African-American clientele. Freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as ""rock and roll"".

In 1951 Little Richard Penniman began recording for RCA Records in the jump blues style of late 1940s stars Roy Brown and Billy Wright. However, it was not until he recorded a demo in 1954 that caught the attention of Specialty Records that the world would start to hear his new uptempo funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock 'n' roll. A rapid succession of rhythm and blues hits followed, beginning with ""Tutti Frutti""[66] and ""Long Tall Sally"", which would influence performers such as James Brown,[67]Elvis Presley,[68] and Otis Redding.[67]

Also in 1951, the song Rocket 88 was recorded by Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm at a studio owned by Sam Phillips with the vocal by Jackie Brenston. This song is often cited as a precursor to rock and roll or as one of the first records in that genre.[69] In a later interview, however, Ike Turner offered this comment: ""I don't think that 'Rocket 88' is rock 'n' roll. I think that 'Rocket 88' is R&B, but I think 'Rocket 88' is the cause of rock and roll existing"".[70]

Ruth Brown, performing on the Atlantic label, placed hits in the top five every year from 1951 through 1954: ""Teardrops from My Eyes"", ""Five, Ten, Fifteen Hours"", ""(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean"" and ""What a Dream"".[61]Faye Adams's ""Shake a Hand"" made it to number two in 1952. In 1953, the R&B record-buying public made Willie Mae Thornton's original recording of Leiber and Stoller's ""Hound Dog""[72] the year's number three hit. Ruth Brown was very prominent among female R&B stars; her popularity most likely came from ""her deeply rooted vocal delivery in African American tradition"".[73][74] That same year The Orioles, a doo-wop group, had the number four hit of the year with ""Crying in the Chapel"".[75]

Fats Domino made the top 30 of the pop charts in 1952 and 1953, then the top 10 with ""Ain't That a Shame"".[76][77]Ray Charles came to national prominence in 1955 with ""I Got a Woman"".[78]Big Bill Broonzy said of Charles's music: ""He's mixing the blues with the spirituals ... I know that's wrong.""[7]: 173

In 1954 the Chords' ""Sh-Boom""[79] became the first hit to cross over from the R&B chart to hit the top 10 early in the year. Late in the year, and into 1955, ""Hearts of Stone"" by the Charms made the top 20.[80]

At Chess Records in the spring of 1955, Bo Diddley's debut record ""Bo Diddley""/""I'm a Man"" climbed to number two on the R&B charts and popularized Bo Diddley's own original rhythm and blues clave-based vamp that would become a mainstay in rock and roll.[81]

At the urging of Leonard Chess at Chess Records, Chuck Berry reworked a country fiddle tune with a long history, entitled ""Ida Red"".[82] The resulting ""Maybellene"" was not only a number three hit on the R&B charts in 1955, but also reached into the top 30 on the pop charts. Alan Freed, who had moved to the much larger market of New York City in 1954, helped the record become popular with white teenagers. Freed had been given part of the writing credit by Chess in return for his promotional activities, a common practice at the time.[83]

R&B was also a strong influence on rock and roll.[84] A 1985 article in The Wall Street Journal, titled, ""Rock! It's Still Rhythm and Blues""[full citation needed] reported that the ""two terms were used interchangeably"" until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&B with pop and country music.[85]

Fats Domino was not convinced that there was any new genre. In 1957, he said, ""What they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I've been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans"".[86] According to Rolling Stone, ""this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties"".[87]

In 1956, an R&B ""Top Stars of '56"" tour took place, with headliners Al Hibbler, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Carl Perkins, whose ""Blue Suede Shoes"" was very popular with R&B music buyers.[88] Some of the performers completing the bill were Chuck Berry, Cathy Carr, Shirley & Lee, Della Reese, Sam ""T-Bird"" Jensen, the Cleftones, and the Spaniels with Illinois Jacquet's Big Rockin' Rhythm Band.[89] Cities visited by the tour included Columbia, South Carolina; Annapolis, Maryland; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York; and other cities.[citation needed] In Columbia, the concert ended with a near riot as Perkins began his first song as the closing act. Perkins is quoted as saying, ""It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt"". In Annapolis, 50,000 to 70,000 people tried to attend a sold-out performance with 8,000 seats. Roads were clogged for seven hours.[90]
Filmmakers took advantage of the popularity of ""rhythm and blues"" musicians as ""rock n roll"" musicians beginning in 1956. Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Big Joe Turner, the Treniers, the Platters, and the Flamingos all made it onto the big screen.[91]

Two Elvis Presley records made the R&B top five in 1957: ""Jailhouse Rock""/""Treat Me Nice"" at number one, and ""All Shook Up"" at number five, an unprecedented acceptance of a non-African American artist into a music category known for being created by blacks.[92]Nat King Cole, also a jazz pianist who had two hits on the pop charts in the early 1950s (""Mona Lisa"" at number two in 1950 and ""Too Young"" at number one in 1951), had a record in the top five in the R&B charts in 1958, ""Looking Back""/""Do I Like It"".[93]

In 1959, two black-owned record labels, one of which would become hugely successful, made their debut: Sam Cooke's Sar and Berry Gordy's Motown Records.[94]Brook Benton was at the top of the R&B charts in 1959 and 1960 with one number one and two number two hits.[95] Benton had a certain warmth in his voice that attracted a wide variety of listeners, and his ballads led to comparisons with performers such as
Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.[96]Lloyd Price, who in 1952 had a number one hit with ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"", regained predominance with a version of ""Stagger Lee"" at number one and ""Personality"" at number five in 1959.[97][98]

The white bandleader of the Bill Black Combo, Bill Black, who had helped start Elvis Presley's career and was Elvis's bassist in the 1950s, was popular with black listeners.[citation needed] Ninety percent of his record sales were from black people, and his ""Smokie, Part 2"" (1959) rose to the number one position on black music charts.[citation needed] He was once told that ""a lot of those stations still think you're a black group because the sound feels funky and black.""[citation needed]Hi Records did not feature pictures of the Combo on early records.[99]

Sam Cooke's number five hit ""Chain Gang"" is indicative of R&B in 1960, as is pop rocker Chubby Checker's number five hit ""The Twist"".[98][100] By the early 1960s, the music industry category previously known as rhythm and blues was being called soul music, and similar music by white artists was labeled blue-eyed soul.[101][94] Motown Records had its first million-selling single in 1960 with the Miracles' ""Shop Around"",[102] and in 1961, Stax Records had its first hit with Carla Thomas's ""Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)"".[103][104] Stax's next major hit, The Mar-Keys' instrumental ""Last Night"" (also released in 1961), introduced the rawer Memphis soul sound for which Stax became known.[105] In Jamaica, R&B influenced the development of ska.[106][107] In 1969, black culture and rhythm and blues reached another great achievement when the Grammys added the Rhythm and Blues category, giving academic recognition to the category.[citation needed]

By the 1970s, the term ""rhythm and blues"" was being used as a blanket term for soul, funk, and disco.[108]

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, hip-hop started to capture the imagination of America's youth. R&B started to become homogenized, with a group of high-profile producers responsible for most R&B hits. It was hard for R&B artists of the era to sell their music or even have their music heard because of the rise of hip-hop, but some adopted a ""hip-hop"" image, were marketed as such, and often featured rappers on their songs. In 1990, Billboard reintroduced R&B to categorize all of Black popular music other than hip-hop.[109] Newer artists such as Usher, R. Kelly, Janet Jackson, TLC, Aaliyah, Brandy, Destiny's Child, Tevin Campbell and Mary J. Blige enjoyed success. L.A. Reid, the CEO of LaFace Records, was responsible for some of R&B's greatest successes in the 1990s in the form of Usher, TLC and Toni Braxton. Later, Reid successfully marketed Boyz II Men.[110] In 2004, 80% of the songs that topped the R&B charts were also at the top of the Hot 100. That period was the all-time peak for R&B and hip hop on the Billboard Hot 100 and on Top 40 Radio.[111]  From about 2005 to 2013, R&B sales declined.[112] However, since 2010, hip-hop has started to take cues from the R&B sound, choosing to adopt a softer, smoother sound that incorporates traditional R&B with rappers such as Drake, who has opened an entire new door for the genre. This sound has gained in popularity and created great controversy for both hip-hop and R&B as to how to identify it.[113] In 2010, the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame was founded by LaMont ""ShowBoat"" Robinson.[114]

According to the Jewish writer, music publishing executive, and songwriter Arnold Shaw, during the 1940s in the US, there was generally little opportunity for Jews in the WASP-controlled realm of mass communications, but the music business was ""wide open for Jews as it was for blacks"".[115] Jews played a key role in developing and popularizing African American music, including rhythm and blues, and the independent record business was dominated by young Jewish men who promoted the sounds of black music.[116]

British rhythm and blues and blues rock developed in the early 1960s, largely as a response to the recordings of American artists, often brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain or seamen visiting ports such as London, Liverpool, Newcastle and Belfast.[117][118] Many bands, particularly in the developing London club scene, tried to emulate black rhythm and blues performers, resulting in a ""rawer"" or ""grittier"" sound than the more popular ""beat groups"".[119] During the 1960s, Geno Washington, the Foundations, and the Equals gained pop hits.[120] Many British black musicians helped form the British R&B scene. These included Geno Washington, an American singer stationed in England with the Air Force. He was invited to join what became Geno Washington & the Ram Jam Band by guitarist Pete Gage in 1965 and enjoyed top 40 hit singles and two top 10 albums before the band split up in 1969.[121] Another American GI, Jimmy James, born in Jamaica, moved to London after two local number one hits in 1960 with The Vagabonds, who built a strong reputation as a live act. They released a live album and their studio debut, The New Religion, in 1966 and achieved moderate success with a few singles before the original Vagabonds broke up in 1970.[122] White blues rock musician Alexis Korner formed new jazz rock band CCS in 1970.[123] Interest in the blues would influence major British rock musicians, including Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, and John Mayall, the groups Free and Cream adopted an interest in a wider range of rhythm and blues styles.[119]

The Rolling Stones became the second most popular UK band (after the Beatles)[124] and led the ""British Invasion"" of the US pop charts.[119] The Rolling Stones covered Bobby Womack & the Valentinos'[125] song ""It's All Over Now"", giving them their first UK number one in 1964.[126] Under the influence of blues and R&B, bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, and more jazz-influenced bands like the Graham Bond Organisation and Zoot Money, had blue-eyed soul albums.[119] White R&B musicians popular in the UK included Steve Winwood, Frankie Miller, Scott Walker & the Walker Brothers, the Animals from Newcastle, [127] the Spencer Davis Group, and Van Morrison & Them from Belfast.[119] None of these bands exclusively played rhythm and blues, but it remained at the core of their early albums.[119]

Champion Jack Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie pianist who toured Europe and settled there from 1960, living in Switzerland and Denmark, then in Halifax, England in the 1970s and 1980s, before finally settling in Germany.[128]  From the 1970s to 1980s, Carl Douglas, Hot Chocolate, Delegation, Junior, Central Line, Princess, Jacki Graham, David Grant, the Loose Ends, the Pasadenas and Soul II Soul gained hits on the pop or R&B charts.[129] The music of the British mod subculture grew out of rhythm and blues and later soul performed by artists who were not available to the small London clubs where the scene originated.[130] In the late 1960s, the Who performed American R&B songs such as the Motown hit ""Heat Wave"", a song which reflected the young mod lifestyle.[130] Many of these bands enjoyed national success in the UK, but found it difficult to break into the American music market.[130] The British white R&B bands produced music which was very different in tone from that of African-American artists.[119]"
"Country pop","Country pop (also known as urban cowboy) is a fusion genre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as the Nashville sound and later on as Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records charting high on the mainstream top 40 and the Billboard country chart. In turn, many pop and easy listening artists crossed over to country charts during this time. After declining in popularity during the neotraditional movement of the 1980s, country pop had a comeback in the 1990s with a sound that drew more heavily on pop rock and adult contemporary. In the 2010s, country pop metamorphosized again with the addition of hip-hop beats and rap-style phrasing.

The joining of country and pop began in the 1950s when studio executives Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley wanted to create a new kind of music for the young adult crowd after ""rockabilly stole away much of country music's youth audience"".[2] According to Bill Ivey, this innovative genre originated in Nashville, Tennessee and thus became known as the Nashville Sound. He believes that the ""Nashville Sound often produced records that sounded more pop than country"" after the removal of the fiddle and banjo. Patsy Cline, Marty Robbins, Jim Reeves, and Eddy Arnold were among the most popular artists during this time.[3] Both Reeves and Arnold had major influence on their RCA labelmate Elvis Presley, apparent not only in secular songs but even more so in country gospel songs. Cline became famous in the early 1960s, gaining widespread acceptance from country and pop audiences alike. Other crossover hits during the 1960s included Skeeter Davis's ""The End of the World"", Sonny James' ""Young Love"", Jeannie C. Riley's ""Harper Valley PTA"", and Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey"".[4] However, the Nashville Sound was not well received by country purists and faced competition on that front, first from the Bakersfield Sound and later the outlaw movement; on the pop side, the format was overshadowed by the British Invasion, which was taking place during the same time that Cline and Reeves died by airplane accident.

The Nashville sound eventually evolved into countrypolitan during the 1970s and had varying levels of success, with several artists recording in the style: Ray Price (""For the Good Times"" 1970), Lynn Anderson (""Rose Garden"" 1970), Charley Pride (""Kiss an Angel Good Morning"" 1971), Mac Davis (""Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me"" 1972), Donna Fargo (""The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A."" 1972 and ""Funny Face"" 1973), Marie Osmond (""Paper Roses"" 1973), Kris Kristofferson (""Why Me"" 1973), Charlie Rich (""The Most Beautiful Girl"" 1974), Billy Swan (""I Can Help"" 1974), Ray Stevens (""The Streak"" 1974), Jessi Colter (""I'm Not Lisa"" 1975), and Crystal Gayle (""Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"" 1977) all charted pop-influenced country hits during the 1970s.

Country pop started when pop music singers like Glen Campbell, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, and Anne Murray (Canada) began having hits on the country charts.  Denver's single ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" went to No. 2 on the Billboard pop charts in 1971, and while the song stalled outside of the top 40 on Billboard's country chart, the album Poems, Prayers, and Promises reached the top 10 on the Billboard Country Album chart and was certified Platinum.[5][6] Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten pop album with Rocky Mountain High, with its title track reaching the pop Top Ten in 1973.[7] At the peak of his popularity in 1974 and 1975, Denver's albums Back Home Again and Windsong reached number one on both the pop and country album charts. His singles were also successful on both charts: ""Sunshine on My Shoulders"" No. 1 pop, No. 42 country; ""Annie's Song"" No. 1 pop, No. 9 country; ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" No. 1 pop and country; ""Back Home Again"" No. 5 pop, No. 1 country; and ""I'm Sorry"" No. 1 pop and country.

Another 1970s crossover artist was Olivia Newton-John, who emerged from Australia in the mid-1970s, hoping to make it big in the United States. Her single ""Let Me Be There"" became a big pop-country crossover hit in 1974. She won a Grammy award for ""Best Female Country Vocal Performance"" for the song and also won the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, ""Female Vocalist of the Year"" (beating out established Nashville artists Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian transplant Anne Murray). Her win sparked a backlash, with several traditional country artists forming the Association of Country Entertainers (ACE) to promote what they considered to be ""real country music.""[8] Newton-John scored a string of pop-country hits in 1974 and 1975 including ""I Honestly Love You"", ""Have You Never Been Mellow"", and ""Please Mr. Please"", before moving away from country in the late 1970s after starring in Grease and focusing mostly on pop music from then onward.

The debate raged into 1975 and reached its apex at that year's Country Music Association Awards when reigning Entertainer of the Year Charlie Rich (who himself had a series of crossover hits) presented the award to his successor, John Denver. As he read Denver's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter. The ACE would only last two years; its two biggest backers, firm traditionalists George Jones and Tammy Wynette, faced a bitter divorce, and Jean Shepard, the other major backer of the ACE, closed down the organization when she could not find others that shared her enthusiasm for the association's purpose.[9]

Although known primarily as a rock performer in the 1970s, Linda Ronstadt had considerable country chart success with ""I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)"" (1974), for which she won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1976, ""When Will I Be Loved"" and ""Love is a Rose"" (1975), and ""Blue Bayou"" (1977).

Several artists principally identified as rock, such as the Eagles and America, scored significant pop chart hits with country rock songs, though they may have reached country charts rarely or not at all.[10][11]

Glen Campbell's ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" was a crossover hit between the pop and country charts in 1975.[12] ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" was produced by blue-eyed soul writer team Dennis Lambert & Brian Potter and written by Larry Weiss. The Bellamy Brothers' ""Let Your Love Flow"", Amazing Rhythm Aces' ""Third Rate Romance"" (1976), Glen Campbell's Southern Nights (1977), and Anne Murray's ""You Needed Me"" (1978) were additional examples of late '70s pop country hits.

In 1977, Kenny Rogers, former frontman of the rock band the First Edition, burst onto the country charts with ""Lucille"" and would go on to rank among the most successful country pop performers.[13]  After ""Lucille"", Rogers had a string of songs that did well on both the country and pop charts around the world, including ""Daytime Friends"", ""The Gambler"", and ""Coward of the County"", all of which were produced by Larry Butler. Rogers would go on to push the boundaries of pop influence in country music, having records produced by the likes of the Bee Gees, Lionel Richie, David Foster, and George Martin, all of which did well in both the pop and country markets. Barbara Mandrell also became known for her blue-eyed soul vocal style. Several of her other hits charted on the country adult contemporary charts, but her songs were the Bubbling under Billboard Top 100 charts. She was one of country music's most successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s. She was involved in a serious car accident in 1984.[14] Her big country hits included ""Sleeping Single In a Double Bed"" and ""(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right.""

In 1977, Dolly Parton crossed over into the pop music world with her No. 1 country and No. 3 pop hit ""Here You Come Again.""[15]

Parton earned another big hit with ""9 to 5"", which topped both the country and pop singles charts in early 1981, supplemented by the 1980 film of the same name.

Country pop reached new heights immediately following the movie Urban Cowboy in the early 1980s. Urban Cowboy was the third music-themed hit film to star John Travolta, each from a different genre; much like Saturday Night Fever did for disco and Grease did for oldies, Urban Cowboy popularized pop-country, helping to boost the career of Mickey Gilley in particular (whose real-life bar and music were featured in the film), along with other songs that appeared on the film's soundtrack.[16]

Willie Nelson and Dottie West came back in the 1980s. Dottie West released a series of hit duets with Kenny Rogers. Kenny Rogers also had a duet hit with Parton, the Bee Gees–penned ""Islands in the Stream"", which topped the country and pop singles charts in late 1983. (The Bee Gees themselves have one credited country hit to their name, 1978's ""Rest Your Love on Me"", which was made an even bigger hit by Conway Twitty in 1980.) Dottie West achieved her biggest success as a country singer during this time, acquiring her first No. 1 hit as a solo artist in 1980 with ""A Lesson in Leaving"".

Oak Ridge Boys, Alabama, Eddie Rabbitt, Juice Newton, Bertie Higgins, and Ronnie Milsap also had crossover success during the early 1980s. The Oak Ridge Boys had a crossover hit ""Elvira"" in 1981. Four of Alabama's most successful songs of the early 1980s—""Feels So Right"", ""Love in the First Degree"", Take Me Down"", and ""The Closer You Get"" (the last two of which were covers of songs by then–pop band Exile)—all reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, while four of Ronnie Milsap's No. 1 songs between 1980 and 1982 reached the Hot 100s Top 20, the most successful of which was the No. 5 hit ""(There's) No Gettin' Over Me"". Rabbitt had three top-5 pop songs in 1980–1981, and ""I Love a Rainy Night"" reached No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Country star Juice Newton also achieved country-pop success with several crossover hits in the early '80s, including ""Queen of Hearts"", ""The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)"", and Grammy-winner ""Break It To Me Gently""; in addition, she wrote ""Sweet Sweet Smile"", the only country hit for easy-listening act the Carpenters. Former pop acts such as Exile, Merrill Osmond (both solo and with his fellow Osmond Brothers), Marie Osmond, Bill Medley (formerly of the Righteous Brothers), Tom Jones, Michael Johnson, Billy Joe Royal, B. J. Thomas, Nicolette Larson, Paul Davis and Dan Seals (""England Dan"" of England Dan and John Ford Coley) began targeting their music at the country market in the early 1980s with a country-pop sound.

Although a number of country pop artists continued to have hits, most notably Alabama, Parton, Mandrell, Rabbitt, and Milsap, the mid-1980s saw a major sea change within the country music industry and the revival of traditional country sounds, as the boost in country's crossover popularity had collapsed; by 1984, country record sales had fallen to the point they were before Urban Cowboy was released.[17]

Country pop enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s, primarily because of the beginning proliferation of country music to the FM radio dial, which in turn was aided by the increase of FCC licenses for suburban and rural FM stations in the late 1980s and an increase in talk radio on the AM dial, as well as a decision by Billboard to no longer count record sales toward the country singles chart, giving country radio full power to determine a chart ranking by their collective airplay. The commercial boom in the industry during this time was also attributable to the rise of talented artists who coincided with the implementation of new marketing strategies that were meant to attract a larger fan base; this further pushed the genre into a pop musical style with an emerging new image.[18]Garth Brooks rose to fame during the 1990s with a string of several extremely successful albums and songs. Shania Twain would rival this success with her three albums The Woman in Me, Come On Over, and Up!. In the last few years, country singer LeAnn Rimes has proved her ability to sing country pop songs such as the record-setting ""How Do I Live"", which spent 69 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, the second longest single in the record history. This achievement came in spite of the fact that a nearly identical version of the same song by Trisha Yearwood was released at the same time and was also a hit. Rimes also had a hit with the pop songs ""Can't Fight the Moonlight"" and ""I Need You"", the latter of which required a remix to be suitable for country radio.

Incorporating elements of pop into country music became extremely popular by the late '90s, thus producing many crossover hits and artists, especially on the adult contemporary charts. Country love songs also became more popular with songs like ""To Make You Feel My Love"", ""Cowboy Take Me Away"", ""I Love You"", ""Breathe"", ""It's Your Love"", ""Just to See You Smile"", ""This Kiss"", ""The Way You Love Me"", ""You're Still the One"", ""From This Moment On"", ""You've Got a Way"", ""Valentine"", etc.

In the 1990s, many country artists experienced huge crossover success. In addition to Brooks, Twain, McBride, and Rimes, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Dixie Chicks, Jo Dee Messina, Martina McBride, Lonestar, Mary-Chapin Carpenter and Wynonna Judd all had songs cross over to Top 40 and/or Adult Contemporary radio, sometimes with remixes eliminating steel guitars and other ""country"" elements to be more suitable for pop radio.  Brooks, Reba McEntire, and other artists also maintained high profiles on the album charts despite having less radio crossover success.

The early 2000s also saw continued success of these artists. Lee Ann Womack scored a big hit with ""I Hope You Dance"", peaking at number one on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart. The Dixie Chicks had continued success with a less mainstream country-pop sound when they released their bluegrass-influenced album Home in 2002. However, by the mid-2000s, there were fewer country acts having crossover success. That was until singer Carrie Underwood won the fourth season of American Idol in May 2005.

With her exposure from American Idol, Underwood's debut single, ""Inside Your Heaven"", became the first song by a prominently country artist to ever debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Underwood continued to have crossover success in 2006 and 2007, with her hit single ""Before He Cheats"", which was notable for becoming a success on mainstream pop radio without a more ""pop-friendly"" remix. Underwood has had additional, but more spotty, success on pop radio since. Nonetheless, she disproved the notion that country artists, especially country female artists, were limited to success only within one genre. Further supplying that evidence was the success of Taylor Swift, who released her debut album in 2006.

Swift rose to fame in the late 2000s as a teenage artist, buoyed by the success of her country pop singles ""Teardrops On My Guitar"" and ""Our Song"", with the latter making Swift the youngest person in history to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Her chart-topping second studio album Fearless was released in 2008; it spawned international hit singles ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong With Me"", becoming two of the best selling singles of all time. In 2009, Swift became the first country artist in history to win an MTV Video Music Award. Later in 2010, Swift won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and Best Country Album for Fearless, becoming the youngest artist to win the top prize at that time. Fearless went on to become Diamond certified by Recording Industry Association of America for moving over 10 million units in the U.S. Her subsequent albums Speak Now (2010) and Red (2012) topped multiple charts globally, including the Top Country Albums and Billboard 200; both of those albums sold 1 million copies in their debut week sales, opening 1.0 million for Speak Now and 1.2 million for Red. On Red, Swift incorporated elements of electronic and dance such as dubstep and worked with pop producers Max Martin and Shellback on several tracks, including the pop hits ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", ""I Knew You Were Trouble"", and ""22"", which were more favored by pop radio over country radio. Swift collaborated with rapper B.o.B on his country rap single ""Both of Us"", and dueted with Tim McGraw on his 2013 single ""Highway Don't Care"" featuring Keith Urban. Swift labeled herself as a pop artist since 2014's 1989, which also won the Grammy awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal album, making Swift the first and only artist to win those awards in both pop and country genres. The subsequent Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) were pop albums, though Lover drew on country influences in songs like ""Lover"" and ""Soon You'll Get Better""; the latter being a collaboration with Dixie Chicks. Swift has also written songs for other country pop acts, such as Little Big Town's ""Better Man"" and Sugarland's ""Babe"". Achieving both national and international prominence through her tour gross, sales records, and critical acclaim, Swift has been credited for bringing recognition of country music ""within the broad expanse of music worldwide""; the Country Music Association acknowledged that her talent and presence ""will have a long-term positive impact on the appreciation of country music for generations to come"".

Other examples of prominent country-pop artists from this decade included Lady A, Sugarland, Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney.

The 2010s saw many changes for the country-pop genre, not only in sound, but also in values; there was a significant shift away from big-voiced power ballads to more casual, hip-hop influenced styles. One such trend was the controversial bro-country subgenre, which Vulture described as ""music by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude.""[19]

During this decade, Uncle Kracker achieved success when his number 3 adult contemporary hit ""Smile"" also became a number 6 country hit. Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson hit number 3 on adult contemporary, 9 on adult pop and 1 on country charts with the song ""Don't You Wanna Stay"". Other records to hit on both the pop and country charts included Miley Cyrus' ""The Climb"", Lady A's ""Just A Kiss"", the Band Perry's ""If I Die Young"", Kelly Clarkson's ""Mr. Know It All"", Hunter Hayes' ""Wanted"", and Florida Georgia Line's ""Cruise"".

Sam Hunt also earned significant crossover appeal. His 2014 debut album Montevallo, which featured hip-hop and rap influences, reached number 1 on Top Country Albums and number 3 on the Billboard 200. His 2017 single ""Body Like a Back Road"" reached number 1 on Hot Country Songs, number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 11 on Adult Top 40.

Hip hop's penchant for story-telling is one of the reasons frequently cited for its influence on mainstream pop country.[20] Additionally, there are now no less than four generations who have grown up listening to both country music and hip hop, as evidenced in the subgenre country rap, starting with Jelly Roll, Colt Ford, Cowboy Troy, and Kid Rock.

In 2016, Morgan Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me in 2018, with strong hip-hop elements like trap beats and snap tracks.[21]If I Know Me included the singles ""Up Down"" (featuring Florida Georgia Line), ""Whiskey Glasses"", and ""Chasin' You""; the album reached number 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[22]

Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021, became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[23] It spent a total of ten weeks at that spot, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[24] The album included Billboard No. 1 singles ""More Than My Hometown"", ""7 Summers"", and ""Wasted on You"".[25]

In 2018, many country artists achieved international pop hit singles in collaborations with mainstream pop artists. This included Chris Stapleton who collaborated with Justin Timberlake on Hot 100 top ten single ""Say Something""; Urban-pop star Bebe Rexha whose duet with the country duo Florida Georgia Line ""Meant to Be"" reached No. 2 both in Australia and in the U.S.; and German DJ Zedd whose dance hit ""The Middle"" featured main vocals from Maren Morris and peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.[26]

Of particular note, in 2012, Billboard restored recording sales to the chart formula but also added airplay from non-country stations, giving an inherent advantage to country pop crossover songs, at the same time maintaining the 1990 formula solely to measure country radio airplay. After the change, crossover songs have increasingly set the record for the longest run atop the country chart for longer and longer stretches; ""Meant to Be"" currently holds the record, 50 weeks and counting as of November 2018, more than double the pre-2012 record (Leroy Van Dyke's ""Walk On By"" was atop the chart for 19 weeks in 1963, during the 1958–1990 period of a unified sales, jukebox and airplay chart; three songs topped the various separate country charts for 21 weeks each between 1948 and 1955).

The way audiences consumed their music also changed during the 2010s, as streaming services became more prominent, thus affecting how artists marketed their songs.[27] Being played on the radio was no longer a requirement to be a contender in the country industry, as it had been for decades before; one such example was Kacey Musgraves. Despite receiving little airplay for her singles sent to country radio, Musgraves won the Grammy award for Album of the Year in 2019, for her fourth studio album Golden Hour.[28] Musgraves's success was unprecedented in the sense that she earned fans from both the pop and country genres without the benefit of airplay on country radio, instead promoting her music through online media platforms such as YouTube and Apple Music.[29][30]The Hoya pointed out Musgraves's groundbreaking approach, writing, ""Musgraves's refusal to bend the knee for Nashville record label executives, coupled with her massive success, proves she is the Nashville big machine's worst nightmare. She is a female artist who managed to find widespread success in an industry that endlessly tried to muzzle her.""[31]

The disparity between male and female artists on country radio became even more obvious during the back half of this decade, with one study finding that male artists accounted for 5.5 to 1 in total airplay during the years 2000–2018.[32] In 2018, that number only increased, with a ratio of male vs. female at 9.7 to 1.[32] In 2015, radio consultant Keith Hill made controversial comments about why women received less representation on the radio, referring to male artists as the ""salad"" and women as ""tomatoes""; the controversy became known as Tomato-gate.[33]

Collaborations between country and pop artists became even more popularized during this decade, as well. In October 2019, country duo Dan + Shay released a joint single with pop singer-songwriter Justin Bieber, ""10,000 Hours"", which went to number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.[34] In April 2020, country singer-songwriter Kelsea Ballerini released ""The Other Girl"" as a joint single with pop singer Halsey from her third studio album kelsea. The single peaked within the top twenty of both the Hot Country Songs and U.S. Adult Top 40 charts. At the February 2020 Country Radio Seminar, there was discussion on the increase in fan attention to pop and country collaborations, in addition to an increase in the use of streaming services.[35]

In 2020, American Idol finalist Gabby Barrett topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs for over 20 weeks with her single, ""I Hope"", which was later remixed into a duet with pop singer-songwriter Charlie Puth.[36] Their collaboration went on to top Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart in October 2020.[37] In its 45th week, the single reached the top five of the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, achieving the slowest climb to the top five in the chart's history.[38]

Two artists who were influential in shifting mainstream attitudes about the genre's more pop-inflected sound were Sam Hunt and Maren Morris. As NPR Music wrote, ""Sam Hunt and Maren Morris arrived on the scene in the years that followed, each of them possessing fluency in the postures and cadences of millennial pop that turned heads and blurred boundaries. '[M]odern country singers love to flaunt phrases and attitudes borrowed from hip-hop, but Hunt's borrowings are softer and sneakier,' noted Kelefa Sanneh.""[39] Jon Caramanica said: ""Think of all the ways dissenters have tried to upend country in recent years: by sneaking in rhythmic vocal tics learned from rappers, by thinning out the genre's musical baggage, by pledging inclusive values. Ms. Morris, an astute synthesizer, has studied and perfected them all.""[39] In an article published in 2019, Time called Morris ""the future of country music.""[40] In November 2020, Morris won three Country Music Association awards, including two for her 2019 single ""The Bones""; it also received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song.[41] The year previously, she won Album of the Year for her sophomore effort Girl, signifying a critical, mainstream shift in attitude about what constituted the country sound.[42][43] ""The Bones"" also received Song of the Year at the 56th ACM awards.[44]

In January 2021, Nashville Scene pointed out the commercial impact and critical acclaim brought on by songs considered to be crossover hits, writing, ""The walls around the country genre seem evermore flimsy these days. Thanks in part to streaming, 'Old Town Road' became the most-certified song in RIAA history earlier this month, racking up 14 million sales. Morris's 'The Bones,' winner of two CMA Awards and nominated for a Grammy, topped four different Billboard charts and peaked at No. 12 on the weekly Hot 100. 'The Middle,' her 2018 dance-pop collaboration with producers Zedd and Grey, peaked at No. 5 on the weekly Hot 100 Songs and was nominated for three Grammys.""[45] Still, the debate on what constituted the country sound continued into the 2020s. Despite placing at the top of Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, Kacey Musgraves's album  Star-Crossed was deemed ineligible for nomination in the Best Country Album category for the 64th Grammys, owing to the policy that potential nominated albums must contain at least ""51 percent of new country recordings"".[46]Billboard, however, pointed out that Musgraves was hardly the first to face controversy from the Grammys; previous records nominated in Pop categories included Dolly Parton's ""Here You Come Again"" and ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" by Glen Campbell.[47] Musgraves did, however, earn two nominations for Best Country Song and Best Country Performance for the album track, ""Camera Roll.""[48]

In 2023, three pop country songs placed within the first four spots on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 for the first time in the chart's 65-year history.[49]Billboard noted the overall increase in the popularity of pop country and credited Morgan Wallen with 40 percent of its growth, calling the phenomenon the ""Wallen Effect"".[50] The popularity of pop country continues to surge, with a 2023 Economist poll finding it has become more popular than hip hop in the United States.[51]"
"Country rap","

Country rap (country hip hop and sometimes hick hop) is a fusion genre of popular music, blending country music with hip hop–style singing or rapping.[1][2]

Early influences on the emergence of country rap as a distinct genre include talking blues like ""Big Bad John"" (1961) by Jimmy Dean, ""A Boy Named Sue"" (1969) by Johnny Cash, the 1971 cover of ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, ""Convoy"" (1975) by C.W. McCall and ""Uneasy Rider"" (1975) and ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" (1979), both by Charlie Daniels. Black artists' works that may have been influential in the genre's development include Jamaican ska artist Prince Buster's ""Texas Hold-Up"" (1964), ""Lil Ole Country Boy"" (1970) by Parliament, and ""Black Grass"" (1972) by Bad Bascomb.[3] Music journalist Chuck Eddy traces the genre's roots back to Woody Guthrie.[4]

Blowfly's single ""Blowfly's Rapp"" (1980) drew on the influence of earlier country musicians like Charlie Daniels and C. W. McCall; NPR said the song is a ""Deliverance-style encounter with Ku Klux Klan-accredited truck drivers to light funkbacking"".[5]Spin Magazine said Trickeration's ""Western Gangster Town"" (1980) (released four years before Schoolly D's ""Gangster Boogie"") is ""cowboy rap's Rosetta stone, and probably the first 'gangster' rap"".[3] Other early examples of country rap are Sir Mix-A-Lot's ""Square Dance Rap"" (1985) where he raps in the voice of a ""white country boy"". The lyric ""From L.A. to Carolina / Drop them suckers in Aunt Jemima"" in Sir Mix-A-Lot's ""Buttermilk Biscuits"" (1988)  is a reference to what many consider a racial stereotype, trademarked after Chris L. Rutt heard a performance of the minstrel song ""Old Aunt Jemima"" (1876).[3]

The song ""Rappin' Duke"" (1985) is a parody of western film star John Wayne: ""Two hundred punks, well, what you gonna do?/I got two six-shooters that'll see me through"". The song also contains a reference to ""Old Folks at Home"" (1851).[3] The genre-blending was not limited only to hip hop artists; country duo Bellamy Brothers released ""Country Rap"" (1987) with lyrics about soul food, church, turnip greens and black-eyed peas.[6]

UGK became pioneers of the hardcore Southern rap style that emerged after the success of the Geto Boys, which they started to call ""country rap"". At the end of ""Let Me See It"", Pimp C raps: ""This ain't no muthafuckin' hip-hop records, these country rap tunes"", originally a response to Northern hip hop artists who had criticized Southern rap for not being ""real hip-hop"".[7] The name of the song ""Hay"" (1996) by Crucial Conflict is a reference to marijuana.[8]

Kid Rock's ""Cowboy"", released in 1999, reflects a cross-section of Kid Rock's country music, Southern rock and hip hop influences,[9] even quoting a piano riff from the Doors song ""L.A. Woman"".[3][10] Kid Rock has described the song as a cross between Run DMC and Lynyrd Skynyrd.[11] Kid Rock's former DJ, Uncle Kracker, was another pioneer of country rap in his solo career.[12]

In the early 2000s, producer Shannon ""Fat Shan"" Houchins and Bubba Sparxxx released Sparxxx's 2001 debut album Dark Days, Bright Nights as an independent release. The blend of country and trap caught the attention of producer Jimmy Iovine who re-released the album on Interscope.[13][14] Houchins soon after created Average Joes Entertainment with Colt Ford.[15] With songs like ""No Trash in My Trailer"" (2008) and ""Drivin' Around Song"" (2013), Ford has sold over one million albums.[16][17][18]

The trend continued in 2005 when country music stars Big & Rich introduced Cowboy Troy and his album Loco Motive. Troy has said he uses ""country instrumentation"" that includes a banjo, fiddle, and acoustic guitar blended with ""shredding rock guitar riffs and a rap delivery.""[19]Hal Crowther has written that ""I Play Chicken with the Train"" (2006) by Cowboy Troy was ""scandalous not because it mixes 'black' rap with 'white' country, but because, through the sheer force of unlikely-but-seamless juxtaposition, it forces us to acknowledge that those two musical styles, at least when they whoop it up, are brothers under the skin"".[20]

In the late 2010s, country rap returned to prominence as part of the ""Yee Haw"" movement, a trend characterized by hip hop producers incorporating country music into their own recordings. Young Thug's 2017 song ""Family Don't Matter"" is credited with popularizing the movement. Artists within ""Yee Haw"" include Lil Tracy and DaBaby.[21] Other country rap artists include Ryan Upchurch, Jawga Boyz, Bottleneck, Moonshine Bandits and Big Smo.[22] Cowboy Troy, Lenny Cooper and The Lacs were three of the top country rap artists of 2013 each with an album on Billboard's Country Chart.[16]

In 2020, Niko Moon's ""Good Time"" peaked at number 20 on the Hot 100[23] – with the track being a hip hop song with country influence, or vice versa.[24] The same year, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus released a heavily rap-inspired country song from his Mama Kush project titled “Ballad of Jed,” while also world-premiering an animated music video, which debuted on Weedmaps in celebration of 4/20.[25]

In 2019, 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X's ""country trap"" single ""Old Town Road"" achieved mainstream international success.[26] Assisted by several subsequent versions, including a remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, the song broke multiple U.S. streaming records and charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for a record nineteen weeks.[27][28] In June 2019, Blanco Brown's ""The Git Up"", also described by USA Today as a ""trap-country"" song, also achieved viral success.[29] Other notable country trap songs include ""Rodeo"" by Lil Nas X and Cardi B and ""Rascal"" by RMR.

The Mo Thugs Family single ""Ghetto Cowboy"" (1998) is noted for featuring a harmonica.[30]Rolling Stone said of ""Cruise (Remix)"" (2012) by Florida Georgia Line featuring Nelly, that the track ""ushered in the wave of escapist fantasies set to syncopated drum loops that became known as 'bro country'.[31][30] Florida Georgia Line has said that Nelly's part ""just connected"", helping to make the ""Cruise"" remix reach the No. 1 and No. 4 positions on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively; it also became the first country single to ever gain a RIAA diamond certification.[32]

B.o.B and pop singer Taylor Swift collaborated on ""Both of Us"" (2012). The track features Swift's country vocals and a blend of hip-hop with banjos. It became a top 10 hit in Australia and New Zealand and a top 20 hit in the US.[33]

Country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J recorded the controversial song ""Accidental Racist"" for Paisley's 2013 album Wheelhouse.[34]

Other collaborations include ""Po' Folks"" (2002) by Nappy Roots with Anthony Hamilton, ""Country Folks"" (2012) by Bubba Sparxxx featuring Colt Ford & Danny Boone, ""Dirt Road Anthem"" (remix) by Jason Aldean and Ludacris, and ""Try Harder Than That"" by Meghan Linsey with Bubba Sparxxx (2014).[30][33]

Physical sales of country rap albums are higher in more rural areas where country rap fans do not have the Internet services required to stream or download music.[35] There are numerous country rap festivals where artists gather to play their music for upwards of 7,000 fans.[35]

The term ""hick-hop"" is often criticized by some southern artists, with Struggle Jennings saying, ""I love the country, I love the South, I've been fishing and hunting, but I'm not a hick. I'm not hick-hop"".[35] The political ideology of country rap artists is perceived as being right-wing or conservative, due to some right-leaning politics expressed by artists like Upchurch and Forgiato Blow;[35] however the political ideology of country rap artists ranges the full spectrum of political beliefs.[35]"
"Country rock","

Country rock is a music genre that fuses rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars.[1] Country rock began with artists like Buffalo Springfield, Michael Nesmith, Bob Dylan, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, The International Submarine Band[2][3] and others, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Linda Ronstadt, Little Feat, Poco, Charlie Daniels Band, and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work,[1] as well as playing a part in the development of Southern rock.

Rock and roll has usually been seen as a combination of rhythm and blues and country music, a fusion particularly evident in 1950s rockabilly.[4] There has also been cross-pollination throughout the history of both genres; however, the term ""country-rock"" is used generally to refer to the wave of rock musicians of the late 1960s and early 1970s who began recording rock songs with country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars.[1] John Einarson states that, ""[f]rom a variety of perspectives and motivations, these musicians either played country with a rock & roll attitude, or added a country feel to rock, or folk, or bluegrass. There was no formula"".[5]

Country influences can be heard on rock records through the 1960s, including the Beatles' 1964 recordings ""I'll Cry Instead"", ""Baby's in Black"", ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"", and their 1965 recording ""I've Just Seen A Face"", the Byrds' 1965 cover version of Porter Wagoner's ""Satisfied Mind"", or the Rolling Stones ""High and Dry"" (1966), as well as Buffalo Springfield's ""Go and Say Goodbye"" (1966) and ""Kind Woman"" (1968).[1] According to The Encyclopedia of Country Music, the Beatles' ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"", their cover of the Buck Owens country hit ""Act Naturally"" and their 1965 album Rubber Soul can all be seen ""with hindsight"" as examples of country rock.[6]

Former TV teen idol and rockabilly recording artist Ricky Nelson pioneered the Country Rock sound as the frontman for his Stone Canyon Band and recorded the 1966 album ""Bright Lights & Country Music"" and the 1967 album ""Country Fever"". Bassist Randy Meisner joined briefly in 1970 after leaving Poco and before joining Eagles.

In 1966, as many rock artists moved increasingly towards expansive and experimental psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival when he went to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, playing with notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy.[7] This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians.[7]

Dylan's lead was also followed by the Byrds, who were joined by Gram Parsons in 1968. Parsons had mixed country with rock, blues and folk to create what he called ""Cosmic American Music"".[8] Earlier in the year Parsons had released Safe at Home (although the principal recording for the album had taken place in mid-1967) with the International Submarine Band, which made extensive use of pedal steel and is seen by some as the first true country-rock album.[1] The result of Parsons' brief tenure in the Byrds was Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968), generally considered one of the finest and most influential recordings in the genre.[1] The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left before the album was released to join another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. The Byrds hired guitarist Clarence White and drummer Gene Parsons, both from the  country band Nashville West. The Flying Burrito Brothers recorded the albums The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969) and Burrito Deluxe (1970), which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career.[1]

Country rock was a particularly popular style in the California music scene of the late 1960s, and was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers, Poco (formed by Richie Furay and Jim Messina, formerly of the Buffalo Springfield) and New Riders of the Purple Sage.[1] Some folk-rockers followed the Byrds into the genre, among them the Beau Brummels[1] and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.[9] A number of performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Beatles, who re-explored elements of country in songs such as ""Rocky Raccoon"" and ""Don't Pass Me By"" from their 1968 self-titled double album (often referred to as the ""White Album""),[10] and ""Octopus's Garden"" from Abbey Road (1969);[11]The Everly Brothers, whose Roots album (1968) is usually considered some of their finest work; John Fogerty, who left Creedence Clearwater Revival behind for the country sounds of the Blue Ridge Rangers (1972);[12]Mike Nesmith, who had experimented with country sounds while with the Monkees, formed the First National Band;[13] and Neil Young who moved in and out of the genre throughout his career.[1] One of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band the Dillards.[1]Doug Dillard left the band to form the group Dillard & Clark with ex-Byrds member Gene Clark and Bernie Leadon.[14]

The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with the Doobie Brothers mixing in elements of R&B, Emmylou Harris (the former singer with Parsons) becoming a star on country radio,  and Linda Ronstadt, the ""queen of country-rock"", creating a highly successful pop-oriented brand of the genre.[15]Pure Prairie League, formed in Ohio in 1969 by Craig Fuller, had both critical and commercial success with five straight Top 40 LP releases,[16] including Bustin' Out (1972), acclaimed by AllMusic critic Richard Foss as ""an album that is unequaled in country-rock"",[17] and Two Lane Highway, described by Rolling Stone as ""a worthy companion to the likes of the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and other gems of the genre"".[18] Former Poco and Buffalo Springfield member Jim Messina joined Kenny Loggins in a very successful duo, while former members of Ronstadt's backing band went on to form the Eagles (two members of which were from the Flying Burrito Brothers and Poco), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included Desperado (1973) and Hotel California (1976).[15] However, the principal country rock influence in the Eagles came from Bernie Leadon, formerly of the Flying Burrito Brothers, and the Eagles are perceived as shifting towards hard rock after he left the band in late 1975. The Ozark Mountain Daredevils had hit singles ""If You Wanna Get To Heaven"" (1974) and ""Jackie Blue"" (1975), the latter of which peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. The Bellamy Brothers had the hit ""Let Your Love Flow""(1976). In 1979, the Southern rock Charlie Daniels Band moved to a more country direction, released a song with strong bluegrass influence, ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"", and the song crossed over and became a hit on the pop chart.[19]

Outside its handful of stars, country rock's greatest significance was on artists in other genres, including the Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work.[1] It also played a part in the development of Southern rock, which, although largely derived from blues rock, had a distinct southern lilt, and it paved the way for parts of the alternative country movement.[1] The genre declined in popularity in the late-1970s, but some established artists, including Neil Young, have continued to record country-tinged rock into the 21st century. Japan even took influence in the 70s with country rock mainly in the kayokyoku genre. Artists such as Takuro Yoshida, Lily and Saori Minami have often dabbled with country rock in their music. Country rock has survived as a cult force in Texas, where acts including the Flatlanders, Joe Ely, Butch Hancock, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and California-based Richard Brooker have collaborated and recorded.[1][20] Other performers have produced occasional recordings in the genre, including Elvis Costello's Almost Blue (1981)[1] and the Robert Plant and Alison Krauss collaboration Raising Sand, which was one of the most commercially successful albums of 2007.[21]Kid Rock, who broke through into mainstream success with a rap rock sound, gradually developed a country rock sound.[22] In 2013, British country rock band Rocky and the Natives released Let's Hear It for the Old Guys with two American members, drummer Andy Newmark and acoustic guitarist Bob Rafkin. Rafkin had written ""Lazy Waters"" for The Byrds from the 1971 album Farther Along, and Andy Newmark had played on the 1973 Gene Parsons album Kindling.  Canadian country rock band Blue Rodeo has found considerable success in Canada, selling multi-platinum albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and continues to receive frequent radio airplay on Canadian radio stations.  Later in 2013 Rocky and the Natives' country rock cover of John Lennon's ""Tight A$"" was included on the Lennon Bermuda album.

A revival of country music blended with rock features in the 2020s was titled ""ronky tonk"" in the music press, with acts such as Zach Bryan, Jackson Dean, and Bailey Zimmerman identified by Billboard.[23][24]Jelly Roll is another crossover artist that blends a unique fashion of country and rock,[25] sometimes with hip hop influences.[26]"
"Outlaw country","

Outlaw country[2] is a subgenre of American country music created by a small group of iconoclastic artists active in the 1970s and early 1980s, known collectively as the outlaw movement, who fought for and won their creative freedom outside of the Nashville establishment that dictated the sound of most country music of the era. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, and David Allan Coe were among the movement's most commercially successful members.

The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like Western, honky tonk, rockabilly and progressive country, and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics.[3][4] The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and limiting structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.[3][5]

Some country fans consider outlaw country a slightly harder-edged variant of progressive country.[6] The outlaw sound has its roots in blues music,[7] honky tonk music of the 1940s and 1950s, rockabilly of the 1950s, and the evolving genre of rock and roll.[4][8] Early outlaws were particularly influenced by predecessors like Bob Wills, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, and Buddy Holly. However, an even greater transition occurred after Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were able to secure their own recording rights, and began the trend of bucking the ""Nashville sound"". According to Michael Streissguth, author of Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings and Nelson became outlaws when they ""won the right"" to record with the producers and studio musicians they preferred.[4]

The 1960s was a decade of enormous change, a change reflected in the music of the time. The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, and many who followed in their wake cast off the traditional role of the recording artist. They wrote their own material, had creative input in their albums, and refused to conform to what society required of its youth. One author states that the Beatnik movement, from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, was a precursor to outlaw country, as participants in both movements emphasized that they felt ""out of place"" in mainstream society.[9]

At the same time, country music was declining into a formulaic genre that appeared to offer the establishment what it wanted with artists such as Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton making the kind of music that was anathema to the growing counterculture. While Nashville continued to be the focus of mainstream country music, cities like Lubbock and Austin became the creative centers of outlaw country.  Southern rock also had a strong influence on the outlaw country movement, and that sound and style of recording was centered in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. In the Western United States, the Bakersfield sound was providing a counterpoint to the traditional Nashville sound, and the counterculture was also giving rise to the fusion genre of country rock, with groups such as the Flying Burrito Brothers and The First National Band (whose lead singer Michael Nesmith had similar creative rebellion against the West Coast music establishment dating to his time with The Monkees).

The movement was named, at various points, ""redneck rock"", progressive country, or ""armadillo country"", after the animal which would become the movement's unofficial mascot, before it was termed ""outlaw country"".[1] The origin of the outlaw label is debated. According to Jason Mellard, author of Progressive Country: How the 1970s Transformed the Texan in Popular Culture, the term ""seems to have sedimented over time rather than exploding in the national consciousness all at once"".[10]

The term is often attributed to ""Ladies Love Outlaws"", a song by Lee Clayton and sung by Waylon Jennings on the 1972 album of the same name.[11] Another plausible explanation is the use of the term a year later by publicist Hazel Smith of Glaser Studios to describe the music of Jennings and Tompall Glaser. Art critic Dave Hickey, who wrote a 1974 profile in Country Music magazine, also used the term to describe artists who opposed the commercial control of the Nashville recording industry.[10]

In 1976, the Outlaw movement solidified the term with the release of Wanted! The Outlaws, a compilation album featuring songs sung by Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. Wanted! The Outlaws became the first country album to be platinum-certified, reaching sales of one million.[12]

As Southern rock flourished, veteran country artists incorporated rock into their music in this genre. Songwriters/guitarists such as Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Hank Williams, Jr. shed the formulaic Nashville sound, grew long hair, and replaced rhinestone-studded suits with leather jackets. Outlaw country artists spoke openly about smoking marijuana.[13] Fiercely independent, the ""outlaws"" abandoned lush orchestrations, stripped the music to its country core, and added a rock sensibility to the sound.[2] At the same time, outlaw country performers brought back older styles that had fallen into disuse, such as honky tonk songs and ""cowboy ballads"".[14] As well, Nelson and Jennings incorporated more R&B and soul music into their country music by working with Memphis and Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section musicians.[13]

The outlaw country artists aimed to resist the big ""machine"" of the Nashville establishment, which ""codified"" norms of sounds, styles, and even appearance and  behavior through influential ""tastemaker"" shows such as Grand Ole Opry.[15] The Grand Ole Opry, which was ""staunchly conservative"", used its influence over Nashville's Music Row to control who could play and what types of songs they could perform. Jennings described his experience in that city's recording industry as like working on an assembly line, in which records were produced like ""clockwork"".[15]

In 1973 Jennings produced Lonesome, On'ry and Mean. The theme song was written by Steve Young, a songwriter and performer who never made it in the mainstream, but whose songs helped to create the outlaw style.[citation needed] The follow-up album for Jennings was Honky Tonk Heroes and the songwriter hero was Texan Billy Joe Shaver. Like Steve Young, Shaver never made it big, but his 1973 album Old Five and Dimers Like Me is considered a country classic in the outlaw genre.[citation needed]

Willie Nelson's career as a songwriter in Nashville peaked in the late 1960s. As a songwriter, he had written a number of major pop-crossover hits, including ""Crazy"" for Patsy Cline and ""Hello Walls"" for Faron Young, but as a singer, he was getting nowhere. He left Nashville in 1971 to return to Texas. The musicians he met in Austin had been developing the folk and rock influenced country music that grew into the outlaw genre. Performing and associating with the likes of Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Martin Murphey and Billy Joe Shaver helped shape his future career.

Williams Jr. had long spent much of his early career in the shadow of his father Hank Williams Sr., who died when Williams Jr. was three years old. In 1975, Williams was severely injured in an avalanche while mountain climbing, disfiguring him to the point where he no longer resembled his father; he grew a beard to hide the scars, which he has maintained ever since. He also began collaborating with the other outlaws, beginning with his album Hank Williams Jr. and Friends released shortly before he was injured.

At the same time as Nelson was reinventing himself, other  influential musicians were writing songs and playing in Austin and Lubbock. Butch Hancock, Joe Ely and Jimmie Dale Gilmore formed the Flatlanders, a group that never sold huge numbers of albums, but continues to perform. The three founders have each made a significant contribution to the development of the outlaw genre. The Lost Gonzo Band and their work in conjunction with Jerry Jeff Walker and Michael Murphey were integral in the birth of Outlaw Country.[16]

Other Texans, like Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle and Guy Clark, developed the outlaw ethos through their songwriting and ways of living.

Although Johnny Cash spent most of his time in Arkansas and Tennessee, he experienced a revival of his career with the outlaw movement, especially after his live albums At Folsom Prison and At San Quentin, both of which were recorded in prisons. Cash had working relationships with Nelson, Jennings and Kris Kristofferson in his later career, culminating in the formation of The Highwaymen; the four would record and perform as a supergroup in addition to their solo careers through the late 1990s. Cash had also been on good terms with several folk counterculture figures, a fact that irked Nashville and television executives (Cash hosted a variety show from 1969 to 1971). Like the other outlaw singers, he eschewed the polished Nashville look with a somewhat ragged (especially in later years), all-black outfit that inspired Cash's nickname, the ""Man in Black"".

The outlaw movement's heyday was in the mid- to late 1970s; although the core artists of the movement continued to record for many years afterward (Nelson, in particular, was recording hits well into the following decade while Hank Williams, Jr. achieved his greatest success during the 1980s), the outlaw movement as a fad was already declining by 1978. By 1980 mainstream country music was practically dominated by country pop artists and crossover acts. The movement was furthermore falling victim to the same pigeonholing and commercialization as mainstream country music; Mickey Newbury, a prominent influence on many outlaw artists, rejected the ""outlaw"" label, stating ""I quit playing cowboys when I grew up.""[17] Williams also noted in his song ""All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)"" that many of the core ""outlaws"" were growing up and abandoning the drugs and hard partying that had driven much of their lives in the 1970s in favor of their home lives and other pursuits. Jennings had a hit song with ""Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand"" in 1978, which likewise attributed the decline to pressures from drug use. Some of the outlaws would have a slight career renaissance in the mid-1980s with the neotraditional country revival, which revived the older styles of both mainstream and ""outlaw"" country music of years past.

The Tulsa sound out of Tulsa, Oklahoma was closely related to outlaw country;[18][19] ""Tulsa Time"" became a hit for Don Williams in 1978, and for Eric Clapton (who, though English, was closely associated with the Tulsa sound in the late 1970s and early 1980s[20]) in 1980. The Tulsa sound, in turn, influenced Red Dirt, a genre that arose out of Stillwater, Oklahoma.[21]"
"Rockabilly","

Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music. It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues,[1][2] leading to what is considered ""classic"" rock and roll.[3] Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll.[4] The term ""rockabilly"" itself is a portmanteau of ""rock"" (from ""rock 'n' roll"") and ""hillbilly"", the latter a reference to the country music (often called ""hillbilly music"" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie-woogie, jump blues, and electric blues.[5]

Defining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, boogie woogie piano riffs, vocal twangs, doo-wop acapella singing, and common use of the tape echo;[6] and eventually came to incorporate different instruments and vocal harmonies.[2] Initially popularized by artists such as Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Johnny Burnette, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, the rockabilly style waned in the late 1950s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a revival. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within musical subcultures. Rockabilly has spawned a variety of sub-styles and has influenced the development of other genres such as punk rock.[6]

There was a close relationship between blues and country music from the very earliest country recordings in the 1920s. The first nationwide country hit was ""Wreck of the Old 97"",[7][8] backed with ""The Prisoner's Song"", which also became quite popular. Jimmie Rodgers, the ""first true country star"", was known as the ""Blue Yodeler"", and most of his songs used blues-based chord progressions, although with very different instrumentation and sound from the recordings of his black contemporaries like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Bessie Smith.[9]

During the 1930s and 1940s, two new sounds emerged. Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys were the leading proponents of Western Swing, which combined country singing and steel guitar with big band jazz influences and horn sections; Wills's music found massive popularity. Recordings of Wills's from the mid 1940s to the early 1950s include ""two beat jazz"" rhythms, ""jazz choruses"", and guitar work that preceded early rockabilly recordings.[10] Wills is quoted as saying ""Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's the same kind of music we've been playin' since 1928!... But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important.""[11]

After blues artists like Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson launched a nationwide boogie craze starting in 1938, country artists like Moon Mullican, the Delmore Brothers, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Speedy West, Jimmy Bryant, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose began recording what was then known as ""hillbilly boogie"", which consisted of ""hillbilly"" vocals and instrumentation with a boogie bass line.[12]

After World War II, The Maddox Brothers and Rose were at ""the leading edge of rockabilly with the slapped bass that Fred Maddox had developed"".[13][14] They had shifted into higher gear leaning toward a whimsical honky-tonk feel, with a heavy, manic bottom end and high volume.[15] The Maddoxes were known for their lively, antic-filled shows, which were an influential novelty for white listeners and musicians alike.[16][17]

Along with country, swing and boogie influences, jump blues artists such as Wynonie Harris and Roy Brown, and electric blues acts such as Howlin' Wolf, Junior Parker, and Arthur Crudup, influenced the development of rockabilly.[5] The Memphis blues musician Junior Parker and his electric blues band, Little Junior's Blue Flames, featuring Pat Hare on the guitar, were a major influence on the rockabilly style, particularly with their songs ""Love My Baby"" and ""Mystery Train"" in 1953.[18][19]

Zeb Turner's February 1953 recording of ""Jersey Rock"" with its mix of musical styles, lyrics about music and dancing, and guitar solo,[20] is another example of the mixing of musical genres in the first half of the 1950s.

Bill Monroe is known as the Father of Bluegrass, a specific style of country music. Many of his songs were in blues form, while others took the form of folk ballads, parlor songs, or waltzes. Bluegrass was a staple of country music in the early 1950s and is often mentioned as an influence in the development of rockabilly, in part owing to its favoring of fast tempos.[21]

The Honky Tonk sound, which ""tended to focus on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity"", also included songs of energetic, uptempo Hillbilly Boogie. Some of the better known musicians who recorded and performed these songs are: the Delmore Brothers, the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Merle Travis, Hank Williams, Hank Snow, and Tennessee Ernie Ford.[22]

Sharecroppers' sons Carl Perkins and his brothers Jay and Clayton, along with drummer W. S. Holland, had established themselves as one of the hottest bands on the honky-tonk circuit around Jackson, Tennessee. Most of the songs they played were country standards with a faster rhythm.[23] It was here that Carl started composing his first songs. While playing, he would watch the dance floor to see what the audience preferred and adjust his compositions to suit, writing them down only when he was sure they were finished. Carl sent numerous demos to New York record companies with no success; the producers believed the Perkins' style of rhythmically-driven country was not commercially viable. That would change in 1955[24][25] after recording the song ""Blue Suede Shoes"" (recorded December 19, 1955) on Sam Phillips' Memphis-based Sun Records. Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.[26][27]

In the early 1950s, there was heavy competition among Memphis area bands playing an audience-savvy mix of covers, original songs, and hillbilly flavored blues. One source mentions both local disc jockey Dewey Phillips and producer Sam Phillips as being influential.[28] An early radio show on KWEM in West Memphis, Arkansas quickly became a mix of blues, country and early rockabilly.[29][30] The Saturday Night Jamboree was a Memphis stage show held every Saturday night at the Goodwyn Institute Auditorium in downtown Memphis, Tennessee from 1953–1954. The Jamboree shows were sometimes broadcast live on KWEM. A number of future notables performed there, including Elvis Presley.[31] The performers often experimented with new sounds in their dressing rooms, incorporating the best ones into their shows.[32]

In 1951 and 1952, brothers Johnny and Dorsey Burnette, as well as Paul Burlison, played a blend of blues, country, and rockabilly at live shows in and around the Memphis area.[29][30] in 1953, they played with Doc McQueen's swing band at the Hideaway Club for a time. While there, they wrote a song called ""Rock Billy Boogie"", named after the Burnette brothers' sons Rocky and Billy (Rocky Burnette later became a rock and roll star in his own right), although they did not record the song until 1957.[33][34] The Burnettes disliked the popular music McQueen played, so they began playing smaller shows on their own, focusing on their budding rockabilly sound.[33] The trio released ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"" in 1956, listed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top 500 rock songs of all time. Many consider this 1956 recording to be the first intentional use of a distortion effect on a rock song, which was played by lead guitarist Paul Burlison.[citation needed]

Elvis Presley's first recordings took place at Sun Records, a small independent label run by record producer Sam Phillips in Memphis, Tennessee.[35] For several years, Phillips had been recording and releasing performances by blues and country musicians in the area. He also ran a service allowing anyone to come in off the street and for a modest fee, record themselves on a two-song vanity record. One young man who came to record himself as a surprise for his mother, he claimed, was Elvis Presley.[36]

Presley made enough of an impression that Phillips deputized guitarist Scotty Moore, who then enlisted bassist Bill Black, both from the Starlight Wranglers, a local western swing band, to work with the young man.[37] The trio rehearsed dozens of songs, from traditional country to gospel.[38] During a break on July 5, 1954, Elvis started playing ""That's All Right Mama"", a 1946 blues song by Arthur Crudup, and Moore and Black joined in. After several takes, Phillips had a satisfactory recording. ""That's All Right"" was released on July 19, 1954.[37][39]

Presley's version of ""That's All Right Mama"" melded country, a genre associated with European-American culture, and rhythm & blues, a genre associated with African-American culture. The resulting track was denied airplay on both country radio stations and R&B stations for being ""too black"" and ""too white"", respectively. Country deejays told Phillips they would be ""run out of town"" for playing it.[citation needed] When the song was finally played by one rogue deejay, Dewey Phillips,[35] Presley's recording created so much excitement it was described as having waged war on segregated radio stations.[citation needed]

All of Presley's early singles featured a blues song on one side and a country song on the other, both sung in the same genre-blending style.[40] Presley's Sun recordings feature his vocals and rhythm guitar, Bill Black's percussive slapped bass, and Scotty Moore on an amplified guitar. Slap bass had been a staple of both western swing and hillbilly boogie since the 1940s. Scotty Moore described his playing style as an amalgamation of techniques he had picked up from other guitarists over the years.[41] Presley's unique musical style rocketed him into the spotlight, and drew masses of followers.[42]

Nobody was sure what to call Presley's music, so Elvis was described as ""The Hillbilly Cat"" and ""King of Western Bop"". Over the next year, Elvis would record four more singles for Sun. Rockabilly recorded by artists prior to Presley can be described as being in the long-standing country style of Rockabilly. Presley's recordings are described by some as quintessential rockabilly for their true union of country and R&B, which can be described as the true realization of the Rockabilly genre. In addition to the fusion of distinct genres, Presley's recordings contain some traditional as well as new traits: ""nervously up tempo"" (as Peter Guralnick describes it), with slap bass, fancy guitar picking, much echo, shouts of encouragement, and vocals full of histrionics such as hiccups, stutters, and swoops from falsetto to bass and back again.[43][44]

In 1955, Elvis asked D.J. Fontana, the drummer for the Louisiana Hayride, to join him for future dates.[45] By that time, many rockabilly bands were incorporating drums, which distinguished the sound from country music, where they were then uncommon. In the 1956 sessions shortly after Presley's move from Sun Records to RCA Victor, Presley was backed by a band that included Moore, Black, Fontana, and pianist Floyd Cramer.[46] In 1956, Elvis also acquired vocal backup via the Jordanaires.[47]

In 1951 a western swing bandleader named Bill Haley recorded a version of ""Rocket 88"" with his group, the Saddlemen. It is considered one of the earliest recognized rockabilly recordings.[48] It was followed by versions of ""Rock the Joint"" in 1952, and original works such as ""Real Rock Drive"" and ""Crazy Man, Crazy"", the latter of which reached number 12 on the American Billboard chart in 1953.[49][50] On April 12, 1954, Haley, performing with his band as Bill Haley and His Comets, recorded ""Rock Around the Clock"" for Decca Records of New York City. When first released in May 1954, ""Rock Around the Clock"" made the charts for one week at number 23, and sold 75,000 copies.[51] In 1955, it was featured in the film Blackboard Jungle, resulting in a resurgence of sales.[52] The song hit No. 1, held that position for eight weeks, and was the number two song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 1955.[53] The recording was, until the late 1990s, recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest sales claim for a pop vinyl recording, with an ""unaudited"" claim of 25 million copies sold.[54]

Maine native and Connecticut resident Bill Flagg began using the term rockabilly for his combination of rock 'n' roll and hillbilly music as early as 1953.[55] He cut several songs for Tetra Records in 1956 and 1957.[56] ""Go Cat Go"" went into the National Billboard charts in 1956, and his ""Guitar Rock"" is cited as classic rockabilly.[55]

In 1953, 13-year-old Janis Martin was performing at the Old Dominion Barn Dance on WRVA out of Richmond, Virginia.[57][58] Martin performed a mix of country songs for the show peppered with rhythm and blues hits in a style that has been described as ""proto-rockabilly"".[59] She later stated, ""the audience didn't know what to make of it. They didn't hardly allow electric instruments, and I was doing some songs by black artists.""[59]

In 1954, both Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins auditioned for Sam Phillips. Cash hoped to record gospel music, but Phillips was not interested. In October 1954, Carl Perkins recorded Perkins's original song ""Movie Magg"", which was released in March 1955 on Phillips's all-country label Flip.[60] Cash returned to Sun in 1955 with his song ""Hey, Porter"", and his group the Tennessee Two, consisting of Marshall Grant on bass, and Luther Perkins (no relation to Carl Perkins) on lead guitar. This song and another Cash original, Cry! Cry! Cry! were released in July.[61]Cry! Cry! Cry! managed to crack Billboard's Top 20, peaking at No. 14.[62]

Presley's second and third singles were not as successful as his first.[63] His fourth release, ""Baby, Let's Play House"", was released in May 1955, and peaked at number five on the national Billboard Country Chart.[64] In August, Sun released Elvis's versions of ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget"" and ""Mystery Train"". ""Remember to Forget"" spent a total of 39 weeks on the Billboard Country Chart, five at the number one spot. ""Mystery Train"", peaked at number 11.[citation needed]

Through most of 1955, Cash, Perkins, Presley, and other Louisiana Hayride performers toured through Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi. Sun released two more Perkins songs in October: ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" and ""Let the Jukebox Keep on Playing"".[65] Perkins and Presley in particular competed as the premier rockabilly artists.[66]

1955 was also the year in which Chuck Berry's hillbilly-influenced single ""Maybellene"" reached high in the charts as a crossover hit, and Bill Haley and His Comets' ""Rock Around the Clock"" was not only number one for eight weeks, but was the number two record for the year.[53] Rock and roll in general, and rockabilly in particular, was at critical mass and the next year, Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel and Don't Be Cruel would top the Billboard Charts as well.[67]

In January 1956, three now-classic rockabilly songs were released: ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash, and ""Blue Suede Shoes"" by Carl Perkins, both on Sun; and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" by Elvis Presley on RCA Victor.[68][69] Perkins's ""Blue Suede Shoes"" sold 20,000 records a day at one point, and it was the first million-selling country song to cross over to both rhythm and blues and pop charts.[70] Perkins first performed ""Blue Suede Shoes"" on television March 17 on Ozark Jubilee, a weekly ABC-TV program. From 1955 to 1960, the live national radio and TV show from Springfield, Missouri featured Brenda Lee and Wanda Jackson and guests included Gene Vincent and other rockabilly artists.[citation needed] On February 11, Presley appeared on the Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show for the third time, singing ""Blue Suede Shoes"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"". Both songs topped the Billboard charts.[67]

Sun and RCA were not the only record labels releasing rockabilly music in 1956. In March Columbia released ""Honky Tonk Man"" by Johnny Horton,[71] King put out ""Seven Nights to Rock"" by Moon Mullican, Mercury issued ""Rockin' Daddy"" by Eddie Bond,[72] and Starday released Bill Mack's ""Fat Woman"".[73] Two young men from Texas made their record debuts in April 1956: Buddy Holly on the Decca label, and, as a member of the Teen Kings, Roy Orbison with ""Ooby Dooby"" on the New Mexico/Texas based Je-wel label.[74] Holly's big hits would not be released until 1957. Janis Martin was only fifteen years old when RCA issued a record with ""Will You, Willyum"" and the Martin-composed ""Drugstore Rock 'n' Roll"", which sold over 750,000 copies.[75] King records issued a new disk by forty-seven-year-old Moon Mullican: ""Seven Nights to Rock"" and ""Rock 'N' Roll Mr. Bullfrog"". Twenty more sides were issued by various labels including 4 Star, Blue Hen, Dot, Cold Bond, Mercury, Reject, Republic, Rodeo, and Starday.[76]

In April and May 1956, The Rock and Roll Trio played on Ted Mack's TV talent show in New York City. They won all three times and guaranteed them a finalist position in the September supershow.[33] Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps' recording of ""Be-Bop-A-Lula"" was released on June 2, 1956, backed by ""Woman Love"". Within twenty-one days it sold over two hundred thousand records, stayed at the top of national pop and country charts for twenty weeks, and sold more than a million copies.[77][78][79] These same musicians would have two more releases in 1956, followed by another in January 1957. ""Queen of Rockabilly"" Wanda Jackson's first record came out in July, ""I Gotta Know"" on the Capitol label; followed by ""Hot Dog That Made Him Mad"" in November. Capitol would release nine more records by Jackson, some with songs she had written herself, before the 1950s were over.[80][81] The first record by Jerry Lee Lewis, who would later be known as a pioneer of rockabilly and rock and roll, came out on December 22, 1956, and featured his version of ""Crazy Arms"" and ""End of the Road"".[82] Lewis would have big hits in 1957 with his version of ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"", issued in May, and ""Great Balls Of Fire"" on Sun.[26][83]

There were thousands of musicians who recorded songs in the rockabilly style, and many record companies released rockabilly records.[84] Some enjoyed major chart success and were important influences on future rock musicians.

Sun also hosted performers, such as Billy Lee Riley, Sonny Burgess, Charlie Feathers, and Warren Smith. There were also several female performers like Wanda Jackson who recorded rockabilly music long after the other ladies, Janis Martin, the female Elvis Jo Ann Campbell, and Alis Lesley, who also sang in the rockabilly style. Mel Kimbrough -""Slim"", recorded ""I Get Lonesome Too""[85] and ""Ha Ha, Hey Hey"" for Glenn Records along with ""Love in West Virginia"" and ""Country Rock Sound"" for Checkmate a division of Caprice Records.[86]

Gene Summers, a Dallas native and Rockabilly Hall of Fame inductee, released his classic Jan/Jane 45s in 1958–59. He continued to record rockabilly music well into 1964 with the release of ""Alabama Shake"".[87] In 2005, Summers's most popular recording, School of Rock 'n Roll, was selected by Bob Solly and Record Collector Magazine as one of the ""100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Records"".[88]

Tommy ""Sleepy LaBeef"" LaBeff recorded rockabilly tunes on a number of labels from 1957 through 1963.[89] Rockabilly pioneers the Maddox Brothers and Rose continued to record for decades.[90][91] However, none of these artists had any major hits and their influence would not be felt until decades later.[92]

In the summer of 1958 Eddie Cochran had a chart-topping hit with ""Summertime Blues"". Cochran's brief career included only a few more hits, such as ""Sitting in the Balcony"" released in early 1957, ""C'mon Everybody"" released in October 1958, and ""Somethin' Else"" released in July 1959. Then in April 1960, while touring with Gene Vincent in the UK, their taxi crashed into a concrete lamp post, killing Eddie at the young age of 21. The grim coincidence in this all was that his posthumous UK number-one hit was called ""Three Steps to Heaven"".

Rockabilly music enjoyed great popularity in the United States during 1956 and 1957, but radio play declined after 1960. Factors contributing to this decline are usually cited as the 1959 death of Buddy Holly in an airplane crash (along with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper), the induction of Elvis Presley into the army in 1958, and a general change in American musical tastes. The style remained popular longer in England, where it attracted a fanatical following right up through the mid-1960s.

Rockabilly music cultivated an attitude that assured its enduring appeal to teenagers. This was a combination of rebellion, sexuality, and freedom—a sneering expression of disdain for the workaday world of parents and authority figures. It was the first rock 'n' roll style to be performed primarily by white musicians, thus setting off a cultural revolution that is still reverberating today.[93][94] ""Rockabilly"" deviance from social norms, however, was more symbolic than real; and eventual public professions of faith by aging rockabillies were not uncommon.[95]

Early rockabilly singer Barbara Pittman told Experience Music Project that ""Rockabilly was actually an insult to the southern rockers at that time. Over the years it has picked up a little dignity. It was their way of calling us 'hillbillies'.""[citation needed]

One of the first written uses of the term rockabilly was in a press release describing Gene Vincent's ""Be-Bop-A-Lula"".[96] Three weeks later, it was also used in a June 23, 1956, Billboard review of Ruckus Tyler's ""Rock Town Rock"".[97]

The first record to contain the word rockabilly in a song title was ""Rock a Billy Gal"", issued in November 1956.[98] The Burnette brothers had been playing a song called ""Rock Billy Boogie"" since 1953, but did not record or release it until 1956 and 1957, respectively.[33][34]

Some effects and techniques strongly associated with rockabilly as a style include slapback, slapback echo, flutter echo, tape delay echo, echo, and reverb.

The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records such as ""Rock Around The Clock"" by Bill Haley & His Comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca's studio in New York, located in an echoing former ballroom called The Pythian Temple. This same studio would also be used to record other rockabilly musicians such as Buddy Holly and The Rock and Roll Trio.[33][99] Memphis Recording Services Studio, where Sam Phillips recorded, had a sloped ceiling covered with corrugated tiles. This created some of the desired resonance, but Phillips used technical methods to create additional echo: the original signal from one tape machine was fed through a second machine with a split-second delay.[100][101] The echo effect was noticeable on Wilf Carter records from the 1930s and in Eddy Arnold's ""Cattle Call"" (1945).[101] When Elvis Presley left Phillips' Sun Records and recorded ""Heartbreak Hotel"" for RCA, the RCA producers placed microphones at the end of a hallway to achieve a similar effect.[citation needed] The echoing sound created the impression of a live show.[102]

In comparison to country songs, rockabilly songs generally have simplified form, lyrics, chord progressions and arrangements, faster tempos, and amplified percussion. There is greater variability in lyrics and melodies, and the singing style is more flamboyant.[103] Compared to rhythm and blues, fewer instruments are used, but percussion is amplified to fill in the sound. The singing style is less smooth and mannered.[103]

The first wave of rockabilly fans in the United Kingdom were called Teddy Boys because they wore long, Edwardian-style frock coats, along with tight black drainpipe trousers and brothel creeper shoes. Another group in the 1950s that were followers of rockabilly were the Ton-Up boys, who rode British motorcycles and would later be known as rockers in the early 1960s. The rockers had adopted the classic greaser look of T-shirts, jeans, and leather jackets to go with their heavily slicked pompadour haircuts. The rockers loved 1950s rock and roll artists such as Gene Vincent, and some British rockabilly fans formed bands and played their own version of the music.

The most notable of these bands was The Beatles. When John Lennon first met Paul McCartney, he was impressed that McCartney knew all the chords and the words to Eddie Cochran's ""Twenty Flight Rock"". As the band became more professional and began playing in Hamburg, they took on the ""Beatle"" name (inspired by Buddy Holly's band The Crickets[104]) and they adopted the black leather look of Gene Vincent. Musically, they combined Holly's melodic songwriting sensibility with the rough rock and roll sound of Vincent and Carl Perkins. When The Beatles became worldwide stars, they released versions of three different Carl Perkins songs, more than any other songwriter outside the band, except Larry Williams, who also added three songs to their discography.[105] (Curiously, none of these three were sung by the Beatles' regular lead vocalists—""Honey Don't"" (sung by Ringo) and ""Everybody's Trying to be my Baby"" (sung by George) from Beatles for Sale (1964) and ""Matchbox"" (sung by Ringo) on the Long Tall Sally EP (1964)).

Long after the band broke up, the members continued to show their interest in rockabilly. In 1975, Lennon recorded an album called Rock 'n' Roll, featuring versions of rockabilly hits and a cover photo showing him in full Gene Vincent leather. About the same time, Ringo Starr had a hit with a version of Johnny Burnette's ""You're Sixteen"". In the 1980s, McCartney recorded a duet with Carl Perkins, and George Harrison collaborated with Roy Orbison in the Traveling Wilburys. In 1999, McCartney released Run Devil Run, his own record of rockabilly covers.[106]

The Beatles were not the only British Invasion artists influenced by rockabilly. The Rolling Stones recorded Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" on an early single and later a rockabilly-style song, ""Rip This Joint"", on Exile on Main St. The Who, despite being mod favorites, covered Eddie Cochran's ""Summertime Blues"" and Johnny Kidd and The Pirates' Shakin' All Over on their Live at Leeds album. Even heavy guitar heroes such as Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page were influenced by rockabilly musicians. Beck recorded his own tribute album to Gene Vincent's guitarist Cliff Gallup—Crazy Legs—and Page's band, Led Zeppelin, offered to work as Elvis Presley's backing band in the 1970s. However, Presley never took them up on that offer.[107] Years later, Led Zeppelin's Page and Robert Plant recorded a tribute to the music of the 1950s called The Honeydrippers: Volume One.[citation needed]

The 1968 Elvis ""comeback"" and acts such as Sha Na Na, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Don McLean, Linda Ronstadt and the Everly Brothers, the film American Graffiti, the television show Happy Days and the Teddy Boy revival created curiosity about the real music of the 1950s, particularly in England, where a rockabilly revival scene began to develop from the 1970s in record collecting and clubs.[108][109] The most successful early product of the scene was Dave Edmunds, who joined up with songwriter Nick Lowe to form a band called Rockpile in 1975.  They had a string of minor rockabilly-style hits like ""I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock 'n' Roll)"". The group became a popular touring act in the UK and the US, leading to respectable album sales.  Edmunds also nurtured and produced many younger artists who shared his love of rockabilly, most notably the Stray Cats.[110]

Robert Gordon emerged from late 1970s CBGB punk act Tuff Darts to reinvent himself as a rockabilly revival solo artist.  He recorded first with 1950s guitar legend Link Wray and later with UK studio guitar veteran Chris Spedding and found borderline mainstream success.  Also festering at CBGB's punk environs were The Cramps, who combined primitive and wild rockabilly sounds with lyrics inspired by old drive-in horror movies in songs like ""Human Fly"" and ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"". Lead singer Lux Interior's energetic and unpredictable live shows attracted a fervent cult audience.  Their ""psychobilly"" music influenced The Meteors and Reverend Horton Heat. In the early '80s, the Latin genre was born in Colombia by Marco T (Marco Tulio Sanchez), with The Gatos Montañeros.[111]The Polecats, from North London, were originally called The Cult Heroes; they could not get any gigs at rockabilly clubs with a name that sounded ""punk"", so the original drummer Chris Hawkes came up with the name ""Polecats"". Tim Polecat and Boz Boorer started playing together in 1976, then hooked up with Phil Bloomberg and Chris Hawkes at the end of 1977.  The Polecats played rockabilly with a punk sense of anarchy and helped revive the genre for a new generation in the early 1980s.

The Blasters, who emerged from the Los Angeles punk scene, included rockabilly among their roots rock influences. The song ""Marie Marie"", first appearing on their 1980 debut album American Music, would later become a breakthrough hit for Shakin' Stevens.

Also in 1980, Queen scored a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with the rockabilly-inspired single ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"".[112]

The Stray Cats were the most commercially successful of the new rockabilly artists. The band formed on Long Island in 1979 when Brian Setzer teamed up with two school chums calling themselves Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom. Attracting little attention in New York, they flew to London in 1980, where they had heard that there was an active rockabilly scene. Early shows were attended by the Rolling Stones and Dave Edmunds, who quickly ushered the boys into a recording studio. The Stray Cats had three UK Top Ten singles to their credit and two bestselling albums. They returned to the US, performing on the TV show Fridays with a message flashing across the screen that they had no record deal in the States.

Soon EMI picked them up, their first videos appeared on MTV, and they stormed up the charts stateside. Their third LP, Rant 'N' Rave with the Stray Cats, topped charts across the US and Europe as they sold-out shows everywhere during 1983. However, personal conflicts led the band to break up at the height of their popularity. Brian Setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles, while Rocker and Phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly. The group has reconvened several times to make new records or tours and continue to attract large audiences live, although record sales have never again approached their early '80s success.[113]

The Jime[114] entered the rockabilly scene in 1983, when Vince Gordon formed his band. The Jime[115] was a Danish Band. The Jime was the band of Vince Gordon, rockabilly guitarist. Not only was he the nerve of the band, Vince Gordon was the band. He composed nearly all its songs and hits.  Vince Gordon also left his mark on the rockabilly scene in many ways. Expert Fred Sokolow[116] talks about the Vince Gordon style in Rockabilly due to his composing.  Vince Gordon had many different musicians in his band. The lifetime of the Jime ended with the death of Vince Gordon in 2016.

Shakin' Stevens was a Welsh singer who gained fame in the UK portraying Elvis in a stage play. In 1980, he took a cover of The Blasters' ""Marie Marie"" into the UK Top 20. His hopped-up versions of songs like ""This Ole House"" and ""Green Door"" were giant sellers across Europe. Shakin' Stevens was the biggest selling singles artist of the 1980s in the UK (with four number ones in the singles chart)[117] and number two across Europe, outstripping Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. Unlike The Stray Cats, who became successful due in part to MTV, Shakin' Stevens' success was initially due to him appearing on various children's television shows in Britain.[118] Despite his popularity in Europe, he never became a big success in the US. In 2005, his greatest hits album The Collection reached number four in the British albums chart, and was released as a tie-in to his appearance on ITV entertainment show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time, going on to become the winner of the series.[119][120][121] Other notable British rockabilly bands of the 1980s included The Jets, Crazy Cavan, Matchbox, and the Rockats.[122]

Jason & the Scorchers combined heavy metal, Chuck Berry and Hank Williams to create a punk-influenced style of rockabilly, often labeled as alt-country or cowpunk. They achieved critical acclaim and a following in America but never managed a major hit.[123]

The revival was related to the ""roots rock"" movement, which continued through the 1980s, led by artists like James Intveld, who later toured as lead guitar for The Blasters, High Noon, the Beat Farmers, The Paladins, Forbidden Pigs, Del-Lords, Long Ryders, The Last Wild Sons, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Los Lobos, The Fleshtones, Del Fuegos, Reverend Horton Heat and Barrence Whitfield and the Savages. These bands, like the Blasters, were inspired by a full range of historic American styles: blues, country, rockabilly, R&B and New Orleans jazz. They held a strong appeal for listeners who were tired of the commercially oriented MTV-style synthpop and glam metal bands that dominated radio play during this time period, but none of these musicians became major stars.[124]

In 1983, Neil Young recorded a rockabilly album titled Everybody's Rockin'. The album was not a commercial success[citation needed] and Young was involved in a widely publicized legal fight with Geffen Records who sued him for making a record that did not sound ""like a Neil Young record"".[citation needed] Young made no further albums in the rockabilly style.[125] During the 1980s, a number of country music stars scored hits recording in a rockabilly style. Marty Stuart's ""Hillbilly Rock"" and Hank Williams, Jr.'s ""All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight"" were the most noteworthy examples of this trend, but they and other artists like Steve Earle and the Kentucky Headhunters charted many records with this approach.[126]

While not true rockabilly, many contemporary indie pop, blues rock, and country rock groups from the US, like Kings of Leon, Black Keys, Blackfoot, and the White Stripes,[127] were heavily influenced by rockabilly.[128]

The Smiths incorporated rockabilly influences in songs such as ""Nowhere Fast"", ""Shakespeare's Sister"" and ""Vicar in a Tutu"". The style also influenced their look towards the end of their 5 year existence in the 1980s. Morrissey also adopted a rockabilly style during the early 1990s, being largely influenced by his guitarists Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte and working with former Fairground Attraction bass-guitarist and songwriter Mark E. Nevin.[citation needed] His rockabilly style was emphasised in the singles ""Pregnant for the Last Time"" and ""Sing Your Life"", as well as his second solo album and tour Kill Uncle.

Irish rockabilly artist Imelda May has been partly responsible for a resurgence of European interest in the genre, scoring three successive number one albums in Ireland, with two of those also reaching the top ten in the UK charts.

UK artist Jimmy Ray incorporated themes and aesthetics of rockabilly music into his image as well as his 1998 hit, Are You Jimmy Ray?, which Ray described as ""popabilly hip hop"".[129]

Singer-songwriter and actor Drake Bell recorded an album of rockabilly covers, Ready Steady Go!, in 2014. The album was produced by Brian Setzer, frontman of the rockabilly revival band The Stray Cats. The album sold over 2,000 copies in its first week of release, peaking at #182 on the Billboard 200, and received positive reviews from critics.

Neo-rockabilly UK band Restless, have played neo-rockabilly since the early 1980s. The style was to mix any popular music to a rockabilly set up, drums, slap bass and guitar. This was followed by many other artists at the time in London. Today, bands like Lower The Tone are more aligned to neo-rockabilly that suits popular music venues instead of the dedicated rockabilly clubs that expect only original rockabilly.[130][131]

The original Rockabilly Hall of Fame was established by Bob Timmers on March 21, 1997, to present early rock and roll history and information relative to the original artists and personalities involved in this pioneering American music genre. It was headquartered in Nashville.[132]

In 2000, an International Rock-A-Billy Hall of Fame and Museum was established in Jackson, Tennessee.[133]
In recent years, the works of both Halls of Fame have been absorbed by Jeffrey L. Cole, son of Bluegrass Pioneer and Rockabilly artist, Lee Cole. Cole’s mission to carry forward the legacy of this Rock and Roll roots genre, with the newly established, Rockabilly Hall of Fame Museum."
"Adult standards","Adult standards (also sometimes known as the nostalgia or Big Band format[1]) is a North American radio format heard primarily on AM or class A FM stations.

Adult standards started in the 1950s and is aimed at ""mature"" adults, meaning mainly those people over 50 years of age,[2] but it is mostly targeted for senior citizens. It is primarily on AM because market research reveals that only persons in that age group listen to music on AM in sizable numbers. Adult standards first became a popular format in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a way to reach mature adults who came of age before the rock era but were perhaps too mature for adult contemporary radio or too young for beautiful music or MOR stations. A typical adult standards playlist includes traditional pop music by artists such as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, some easy listening numbers from Roger Whittaker and others, and softer tunes from the oldies and adult contemporary music formats.

As originally conceived, the format features big band music, particularly from the 1940s and 1950s,[1] though most modern stations eschew that genre. Younger artists who record in the big-band era style, such as Harry Connick Jr., or Diana Krall, may be played as well. The term ""standards"" in the format's title is a reference to the standard, a song that is covered extensively by many artists over a prolonged period of time; adult standards may play true standards but are not limited to them.

According to Nielsen Audio, there were 129 stations with adult standards/MOR as format in 2016.[3]: 95  Because the adult standards audience has increased in age to the point where many of its listeners have either died or are no longer attractive to advertisers, the format as it is known today (much like the contemporary decline of oldies and smooth jazz formats, along with the earlier demise of easy listening) is likely to die out. Most independently programmed former adult standards stations have transitioned to other formats such as oldies, classic hits, or adult contemporary music that have similar music but skew toward more modern songs.

Only about a handful of adult standards stations today are live and locally programmed around-the-clock. Many have affiliated with nationally distributed satellite formats to cut costs; due to advertiser perceptions about the audiences these stations primarily target, a large number of adult standards stations have trouble selling airtime to advertisers, which makes them unprofitable. For example, KIXI 880 AM, serving the Seattle market and KKIN 930 AM, serving Aitkin, terminated its local airstaff to affiliate with the Music of Your Life network. Many others have simply dumped the format altogether, often for all-talk or all-sports formats, oldies, or other formats deemed by management more profitable than standards.

Music of Your Life is an adult standards format that probably more than any other source defined the format. Music of Your Life, was founded by Al Ham in 1978 and boasts a roster of well-known personalities including Peter Marshall, Steve March-Torme, son of the legendary crooner, Mel Tormé, big band leader Les Brown, Jr., radio veteran Al Hardee, Lorri Hafer, daughter of founder Al Ham, and weekend host Pat Boone. Following an internal shakeup in 2008, business developer, Marc Angell took over the fledgling network and moved the company's broadcasting operations to Denver, Colorado, under a distribution deal with Clear Channel Satellite. Music of Your Life is currently distributed by Music of Your Life, Inc. a publicly traded company listed on the OTC markets under the ticker symbol, MYLI, and is distributed to AM, FM, and HD radio stations using the Barix system.

Dial Global (formerly part of Westwood One) has an adult standards format distributed via satellite; Dial Global's is called ""Adult Standards"" (known on-air as ""America's Best Music""). Prior to 2010, ABC distributed Stardust/Timeless Classics/Timeless. Stardust/Timeless Classics was consolidated with a middle-of-the-road format owned by ABC—Unforgettable Favorites/Memories—in 2006, creating Timeless. Westwood One originally called its format AM Only and for a time, as the name suggests, offered the format only to AM stations; today, a handful of FM stations also air Westwood One's format.

While Music of Your Life has not eliminated all of the big-band and traditional pop music from its playlist, Westwood One and ABC dropped much of the older music in favor of softer pop and rock oldies from the 1960s and 1970s top 40 era and a good deal of soft AC material as well. Under Dial Global, some of the older-style songs are making a comeback on the Westwood One format. ABC discontinued its Timeless service early in 2010; that same year, Music of Your Life added more 1960s oldies to its playlist.

iHeartMedia's Format Lab also features at least two adult standards formats.

Some noteworthy AM & FM radio stations featuring the adult standards format today include:

Moving into the 21st Century, adult standards have been given a lift as a format by new media, such as:"
"Downtempo","Downtempo (or downbeat)[4] is a broad label for electronic music that features an atmospheric sound and slower beats than would typically be found in dance music.[5] Closely related to ambient music but with greater emphasis on rhythm,[6] the style may be played in relaxation clubs or as ""warm-up or cool-down"" music during a DJ set.[5] Examples of downtempo subgenres include trip hop, ambient house, chillwave, psybient and lofi hip hop.[5]

The style emerged in the late 1980s with the UK's Bristol scene that birthed artists like Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky.[5] In the 1990s, the style was heard internationally in artists such as Kruder & Dorfmeister, Fila Brazillia, and Thievery Corporation.[5] Other prominent artists to emerge in the style include Underworld, Orbital, Fluke, Boards of Canada, Nicolas Jaar, and Bonobo.[5]

Downtempo music is a broad genre but is united by several characteristics:

Downtempo emerged from the UK's late-1980s Bristol sound, which developed a slow, psychedelic fusion of hip hop with electronic music known as ""trip hop"" and birthed artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky.[5] The 1990s brought on a wave of slower paced music which was played throughout chillout rooms—the relaxation sections of the clubs or dedicated sections at electronic music events.[7] UK act Nightmares on Wax helped to pioneer downtempo electronica in the early 1990s, drawing on dub reggae and hip-hop.[8] Downtempo music also started to surface around Ibiza, when DJs and promoters would bring down the vibe with slower rhythm and gentler electronic music upon approaching sunrise. At the end of the 1990s a more melodic instrumental electronica incorporating acoustic sounds with electronic styles emerged under its own umbrella name of downtempo.[9]

In the late 1990s, the Austrian duo Kruder & Dorfmeister popularized the style with their downtempo remixes of pop, hip-hop, and drum and bass tracks with influences of the '70s soul jazz.  Britons Steve Cobby and Dave McSherry, producing under the name Fila Brazillia, released a handful of downtempo, electronica and ambient techno albums that propelled the style further. Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C. locals Eric Hilton and Rob Garza, better known as Thievery Corporation, have introduced the Brazilian sound into the style after discussing the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, and enriched it further by combining elements of Jamaican dub and reggae.[10]

In 2010, ""downtempo pop"" was described by The Atlantic as a variety of music styles from the 2000s characterized by mellow beats, vintage synthesizers, and lo-fi melodies. In other words, an umbrella term that includes chillwave, glo-fi, and hypnagogic pop.[3] Later in the decade, another form of downtempo music, tagged as ""lo-fi hip hop"" or ""chillhop"", became popular among YouTube music streamers.[11]"
"Light music","

Light music is a less-serious form of Western classical music, which originated in the 18th and 19th centuries and continues today. Its heyday was in the mid‑20th century.[1][2] The style is through-composed, usually shorter orchestral pieces and suites designed to appeal to a wider context and audience than more sophisticated forms such as the concerto, the symphony and the opera.

Light music was especially popular during the formative years of radio broadcasting, with stations such as the BBC Light Programme (1945–1967) playing almost exclusively ""light"" compositions.

Occasionally also known as mood music and concert music, light music is often grouped with the easy listening genre.[3] Light music was popular in the United Kingdom, the United States and in continental Europe, and many compositions in the genre remain familiar through their use as themes in film, radio and television series.

Before Late Romantic orchestral trends of length and scope separated the trajectory of lighter orchestral works from the Western Classical canon, classical composers such as Mozart and Haydn won as much fame for writing lighter pieces such as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik as for their symphonies and operas. Later examples of early European light music include the operettas of composers such as Franz von Suppé or Sir Arthur Sullivan; the Continental salon and parlour music genres; and the waltzes and marches of Johann Strauss II and his family.[4] The Straussian waltz became a common light music composition (note for example Charles Ancliffe's ""Nights of Gladness"" or Felix Godin's ""Valse Septembre""). These influenced the foundation of a ""lighter"" tradition of classical music in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the UK, the light-music genre has its origin in the seaside and theatrical orchestras that flourished in Britain during the 19th and early 20th century.[5][6] These played a wide repertoire of music, from classical music to arrangements of popular songs and ballads of the time. From this tradition came many specially written shorter orchestral pieces designed to appeal to a wider audience.

Composers such as Sir Edward Elgar wrote a number of popular works in this medium, such as the ""Salut d'Amour"", the Nursery Suite, and Chanson de Matin.[5] The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham became famous for concluding his otherwise serious orchestral concerts with what he termed ""lollipops"", meaning less serious, short or amusing works chosen as a crowd-pleasing encore.[7] Influenced by the earlier ""promenade concerts"" held in London pleasure gardens, a similar spirit embued many of Henry Wood's early Queen's Hall Proms concerts, especially the ""Last Night of the Proms"".[8]

With the introduction of radio broadcasting by the BBC in the 1920s the style found an ideal outlet. This increased after the launch of the BBC Light Programme in 1945, featuring programmes such as Friday Night is Music Night and Music While You Work.[9]

In the United States, ""pop orchestras"" such as the Boston Pops began to emerge in the 19th century. The Boston Pops was founded in 1885 as a second, popular identity of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), founded four years earlier. They commissioned light pieces by composers such as Leroy Anderson, Ferde Grofé, and George Gershwin to write original works, along with theatre music, film music and arrangements of popular music and show tunes.

The British light music composer Ernest Tomlinson stated that the main distinction of light music is its emphasis on melody.[11] This is certainly a major feature of the genre, although the creation of distinctive musical textures in scoring is another aim, for example the close harmony of Robert Farnon or Ronald Binge's ""cascading string"" effect, which later became associated with the ""sustained hum of Mantovani's reverberated violins"".[12] Lyndon Jenkins describes the genre as ""original orchestral pieces, often descriptive but in many cases simply three or four minutes of music with an arresting main theme and a contrasting middle section.""[5]

David Ades suggests that ""it is generally agreed that it occupies a position between classical and popular music, yet its boundaries are often blurred"".[13] He goes on to cite broadcaster Denis Norden who said that light music was ""not just tuneful round the outside, but tuneful right through.""[13]

Often, the pieces represent a mood, place, person or object, for example Farnon's ""Portrait of a Flirt"", Albert Ketèlbey's In a Monastery Garden or Edward White's ""Runaway Rocking Horse"".[14] The genre's other popular title ""mood music"" is a reference to pieces such as Charles Williams' A Quiet Stroll, which is written at an andante pace and has a jaunty, cheery feel.[15] Light music pieces are usually presented individually or as movements within a suite, and are often given individual descriptive titles. These titles can sometimes be unusual or idiosyncratic, such as Frederic Curzon's ""Dance of the Ostracised Imp"".[16]

In keeping with this tradition of levity, pieces can also feature musical jokes at the expense of more ""serious"" works, such as Eric Fenby's overture Rossini on Ilkla Moor[17] or Arthur Wilkinson's Beatlecracker Suite, which arranges songs by The Beatles in the style of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker.[18]

The genre is often associated with the easy listening orchestral arrangements of Mantovani, Percy Faith and Henry Mancini, although with the exception of Mancini these composers are better known for their arrangements rather than through-composed original compositions.[12] As a result of this association, the music is sometimes linked to the genres of lounge music or Exotica, but light music generally does not feature vocals, synthesisers or popular music instruments.[5][19]

It can also sometimes be grouped with the background music and elevator music created for commercial background music players such as the Seeburg 1000 by Seeburg Corporation or Cantata 700 (3M) as well as the works of Muzak Orchestra (Muzak as a company): back in the 1950's, the 1960's and the 1970's, the background music were light orchestral arrangements of popular music played in shops, hotels and airlines.

In the 1950s and 1960s many light composers wrote Production Library music for use in film, radio and television, and as a result, many light music compositions are familiar as theme music, an example being Trevor Duncan's March from a Little Suite, used by the BBC as the theme to Dr. Finlay's Casebook in the 1960s, or Edward White's ""Puffin' Billy"" being the theme to both the BBC radio series Children's Favourites and the CBS children's programme Captain Kangaroo.

Eric Coates' marches in particular were popular choices as theme music. The ""Dambusters March"", possibly his most famous work, was used as the title theme to the 1954 film and has become synonymous with the film and the mission itself.[20] Other Coates works used as theme music include ""Calling All Workers"" for Music While You Work, ""Knightsbridge"" for In Town Tonight and ""Halcyon Days"" as the theme to The Forsyte Saga.

Coates was also commissioned to write original marches for television stations including the ""BBC Television March"", ATV's ""Sound and Vision March"" and Associated Rediffusion's ""Music Everywhere"". Other noteworthy television startup themes include William Walton's Granada Preludes, Call Signs and End Music for Granada Television, Robert Farnon's Derby Day for Radiotelevisão Portuguesa, Richard Addinsell's Southern Rhapsody for Southern Television, Ron Goodwin's Westward Ho! for Westward Television and John Dankworth's Widespread World for Rediffusion London.[21]

Several pieces of light music are used on BBC Radio 4 to the present day, with Eric Coates's ""By the Sleepy Lagoon"" being the theme of Desert Island Discs, Arthur Wood's ""Barwick Green"" the theme of The Archers and Ronald Binge's ""Sailing By"" preceding the late-night shipping forecast.

During the 1960s, the style began to fall out of fashion on radio and television, forcing many light composers to refocus their energy on writing more serious works or music for film. Robert Farnon completed several symphonies in the later part of his life, as well as composing for television, for example Colditz.[22] The light composers' skills of classical orchestration and arrangement were appreciated by composers such as John Williams, with both Angela Morley and Gordon Langford asked to help orchestrate his film scores for Star Wars (1977) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) amongst others.[23][24]

Many orchestras specialising in playing light music were disbanded. Small palm court orchestras, once common in hotels, seaside resorts and theatres were gradually lost in favour of recorded music. The BBC began to discard its archive of light music, much of which was saved by composer Ernest Tomlinson and is now kept at his Library of Light Orchestral Music.[25] However, the genre was kept in the public consciousness by its use in advertisements and television programmes, often used as a nostalgic evocation of the 1940s and 1950s.[9]

During the 1990s, the genre began to be re-discovered and original remastered recordings by orchestras such as the Queen's Hall Light Orchestra were issued on compact disc for the first time.[26] This was followed by new recordings of light music by orchestras such as the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, the New London Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra, as well as continued public concerts by orchestras such as the Cambridge Concert Orchestra, the Scarborough Spa Orchestra and Vancouver Island's Palm Court Light Orchestra. The style also found a new home on BBC Radio 3 on Brian Kay's Light Programme, although this programme was discontinued in February 2007.[27][28] In 2007, BBC Four broadcast an evening of light music as part of a themed evening celebrating British culture between 1945 and 1955, which included Brian Kay's documentary Music for Everybody and a televised version of Friday Night is Music Night.[29]

In the UK, US and Canada, light music can still be heard on some of the radio channels that specialise in classical music: for example Classic FM in the UK,[30] and XLNC1 in Mexico.[31] A nationwide participatory festival of light music called ""Light Fantastic"" was organised by BBC Radio 3 in June 2011 as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1951 Festival of Britain.[32][33] This included events in London, Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow, from both professional and amateur ensembles, including a live revival of Music While You Work from a factory in Irlam near Manchester, several light music concerts from the Southbank Centre and a number of documentaries about the genre.[32]

Light music is also frequently used as incidental music in radio and television programmes, for example Charles Williams' ""Devil's Galop"" (once famous as the theme to Dick Barton: Special Agent) is now often used in spoofs of 1950s action programmes, such as Mitchell and Webb's The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken-Caesar sketches.[34] Mitchell and Webb also use Acker Bilk's ""Stranger on the Shore"" as the theme music of their radio sketch show.[35]

There are hundreds of composers who can be considered to have written ""light music"", although composers whose oeuvre focussed primarily on lighter works include Charles Ancliffe, Ronald Binge, Eric Coates, Frederic Curzon, Trevor Duncan, Robert Farnon, Adalgiso Ferraris, Ron Goodwin, Heinz Kiessling, Albert Ketèlbey, Billy Mayerl, Angela Morley, Ernest Tomlinson, Sidney Torch, Edward White, Charles Williams, Alberto Semprini and Haydn Wood. Each of these composers worked during the ""golden age"" of light music from roughly 1920–1960.[36][37]"
"Soft rock","

Soft rock (also known as light rock) is a form of rock music that originated in the late 1960s in Southern California and the United Kingdom which smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop rock,[1] relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. Soft rock was prevalent on the radio throughout the 1970s and eventually metamorphosed into a form of the synthesized music of adult contemporary in the 1980s.[1]

Softer sounds in rock music could be heard in mid-1960s songs, such as ""A Summer Song"" by Chad & Jeremy (1964) and ""Here, There and Everywhere""[4] by the Beatles and ""I Love My Dog""[5] by Cat Stevens, both from 1966.

By 1968, hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre. From the end of the 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock,[6] with both emerging as major radio formats in the US.[7] Late 1960s soft rock artists include the Bee Gees,[8] whose song ""I Started a Joke"" was a number one single in several countries; Neil Diamond with the 1969 hit ""Sweet Caroline"", the Hollies with their US and UK top 10 hit ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"", and Elton John with his popular song ""Skyline Pigeon"".

By the early 1970s, softer songs by the Carpenters, Anne Murray, John Denver, Barry Manilow, and even Barbra Streisand began to be played more often on ""top 40"" radio and others were added to the mix on many adult contemporary stations.

Major artists of that time included Bread,[9][10]Carly Simon, Carole King, Cat Stevens, James Taylor,[11]Lobo and Gilbert O'Sullivan who achieved number-one hit singles between 1970 and 1972 with ""Nothing Rhymed"", ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" and ""Clair"".

The Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s when the texture of much of the music played on top 40 radio once more began to soften. The adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it, with rock-oriented acts as Chicago, the Eagles and Elton John becoming associated with the format. The Carpenters' hit version of ""(They Long to Be) Close to You"" was released in the summer of 1970, followed by Bread's ""Make It with You"", both early examples of a softer sound that was coming to dominate the charts.[12]

The soft rock album Tapestry by Carole King, released in February 1971, became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The lead double-sided single from the album, ""It's Too Late""/""I Feel the Earth Move"", spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 beginning in mid-June 1971.[13]

Los Angeles station KNX-FM, under program director Steve Marshall, introduced a ""mellow rock"" format in 1971.[14]

Albert Hammond scored a major hit single with ""It Never Rains in Southern California"" in 1972, which went top 10 in at least six countries including Canada and the U.S. at numbers 2 and 5, respectively.

In the spring of 1972, Neil Young scored his only number-one single with ""Heart of Gold"", from the album Harvest. Topping the charts in both the U.S. and Canada, this soft rock ballad featured backing vocals from Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor, heard near the end of the song.[15]

In 1973, Paul McCartney and Wings had a U.S. number one with ""My Love"", which also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary charts of both the U.S. and Canada.

Soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid-to-late 1970s with acts such as Toto, England Dan & John Ford Coley, Air Supply, Seals and Crofts, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.[16]

Denver station KIMN-FM introduced a ""mellow rock"" album format in 1975. Program director Scott Kenyon told Billboard magazine, Michael Murphey's ""Wildfire"" is a perfect example; it feels like Colorado, you can tell it came from this part of the country. There's a sound of the Rockies... the best description is mellow rock. Take that kind of music and make it into a Colorado sounding station.""[17]

By 1977, some radio stations, notably New York's WTFM and NBC-owned WYNY, had switched to an all-soft rock format.[18] Chicago's WBBM-FM adopted a soft rock/album rock hybrid format in 1977 and was known as ""Soft Rock 96"" presenting the ""Mellow sound of Chicago"". Five years later, they would flip to a ""Hot Hits"" top 40 format.[19]

In the mid- to late 1970s, prominent soft rock acts included Billy Joel, Elton John, Jefferson Starship, Chicago, Toto, Boz Scaggs, the Alessi Brothers, Michael McDonald, Paul Davis, Eric Carmen, the Doobie Brothers, the Alan Parsons Project, Captain & Tennille, the Hollies, and Dr. Hook.

By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as Journey.[20]

A prominent counterpart of soft rock in the late 1970s and early 1980s came to be known as yacht rock;[21] its name coined in 2005 by the makers of the online video series Yacht Rock. Originating from California's session musicians, yacht rock only partially overlapped with soft rock; it could include soft to mid-level (but rarely ever purely hard) rock.[22] Much of the ""West Coast sound"" of yacht rock bore similarity to some of the East Coast soft rockers of the era such as Rupert Holmes and Hall & Oates, leading to the conflation.[23]

In the early 1980s, the radio format evolved into what came to be known as ""adult contemporary"" or ""adult album alternative"", a format that has less overt rock bias than its forebear radio categorization.[24] In Los Angeles, KOST 103.5 FM, under program director Jhani Kaye, debuted its soft adult contemporary format in November 1982.[25] Soft rock songs still enjoyed success from artists such as Sheena Easton, Ambrosia, Lionel Richie, Christopher Cross, Dan Hill, Gino Vannelli, Leo Sayer, Air Supply, Julio Iglesias and Bertie Higgins.

Chris Norman, former lead singer of the band Smokie, scored several solo hits between 1986 and 1988 in Europe, particularly in Germany, including ""Some Hearts Are Diamonds"", ""Broken Heroes"" and ""Midnight Lady"", the latter reaching number one in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.

Soft rock persisted in the 1990s, with artists from previous decades continuing to release new music, such as Genesis, whose 1992 soft rock single ""Hold on My Heart""[26] topped the Canadian singles chart and Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.[27][28]Extreme's 1991 single ""More Than Words""[29] was internationally successful, topping the national singles charts in at least five countries, including Canada and the United States.[30][31][32]Mr. Big's 1992 single ""To Be with You"" was a number one hit in at least twelve countries. Eric Clapton's 1992 single ""Tears in Heaven""[33] was also successful, topping the national singles charts in Canada,[34] Ireland,[35] New Zealand,[36] and six other countries.[37][38][39][40]

Richard Marx's 1994 single ""Now and Forever""[41] topped the Canadian adult contemporary chart[42] and peaked in the top ten of the national singles charts in that country,[43] Norway,[44] and the United States.[45] New bands and artists emerged such as the Danish band Michael Learns to Rock, who saw massive popularity in Asia, with many singles becoming commercially successful in the continent starting with their 1991 hit ""The Actor"",[46] and Australian band Southern Sons, who enjoyed success on the ARIA Charts with three top 10 singles.[47]

"Future bass","

Future bass is a style of electronic dance music which developed in the 2010s that mixes elements of dubstep and trap with warmer, less abrasive rhythms.[1] The genre was pioneered by producers such as Rustie, Hudson Mohawke, Lido, San Holo and Cashmere Cat,[2][3] and it was popularised in the mid to late-2010s by artists such as Flume, Martin Garrix, Illenium, Louis the Child and Mura Masa.[4] 2016 was seen as the breakout year for the genre.[5][6][7]

The genre was pioneered by Scottish producers Rustie and Hudson Mohawke and American producer RL Grime, who began producing future bass tracks in 2010.[8][9] One of the first popularity-fueling releases in the genre was Rustie's album Glass Swords, released in 2011.[10] Later, in 2013, the Flume remix of Disclosure's song ""You & Me"" brought the genre into the mainstream,[11] and through the mid-2010s future bass became popular in the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China, Korea and Australia.[8]

The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter), or the wave's amplitude, to adjust the waveform (to create a ‘wobbly’ effect on its parameters). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat ""twinkly""-sounding gradual rise in pitch during ""risers"" (gradual pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops, or vocoders.[1]

The BPM of future bass is often set between 130BPM to 175BPM,[12] and the tracks often use a 4/4 time signature. However, a song does not have to follow those criteria to be considered ""future bass"".

Kawaii future bass (also known simply as kawaii bass) is a subgenre of future bass, known for its happy and cute timbre and strong Japanese pop culture influences. Often, chiptune sounds, soft square waves, samples from anime or video games, percussion instruments, and door and bed squeaks are incorporated into such songs. Snail's House and other producers have produced tracks of this subgenre,[13] with the former being credited as the genre pioneer after releasing the extended play Kirara in 2015.[14]"
"Trip hop","

Trip hop is a musical genre that originated in the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol.[3] It has been described as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound,[4][5][6] often incorporating elements of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, R&B, and other forms of electronic music, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.[7]

The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s,[8] incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, and rap music.[9] It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, Tricky, and Portishead.[10] The term was first coined in a 1994 Mixmag piece about American producer DJ Shadow.[11] Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as ""Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s"".[8]

Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat,[12] often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel.[12] Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack[13] and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird,[14] and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.[15]

Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands;[16] Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees[17][18] and the Cure.[19][20] Tricky opened his second album Nearly God with a version of ""Tattoo"", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.[21]

Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn,[22] combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to ""transcend"" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.[23]

The term ""trip-hop"" first appeared in print in June 1994.[24] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, used it to describe ""In/Flux"", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.[25][26]

In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems.[27] Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (""down tempo"").

Bristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed ""the Bristol Sound"".[27] The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence the MC Adrian ""Tricky Kid"" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert ""3D"" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew ""Mushroom"" Vowles and Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s,[28] the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack,[29] a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.[29]

Another influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart.[30] The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label.[31] Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released ""Angel"", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s.

Massive Attack's first album Blue Lines was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom.[33]Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single ""Unfinished Sympathy"" and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Produced by Dollar, Shara Nelson (R&B singer) featured on the orchestral ""Unfinished"", and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career.[34] Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away from the Wild Bunch era.

In the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine Mixmag, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term trip hop to describe the hip hop instrumental ""In/Flux"", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. ""In/Flux"", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton.[35] Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre.

In 1993, Icelandic musician Björk released Debut, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper.[36] The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop.[37][38] She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Björk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album Post by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. Homogenic, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.[39]

Trip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle & Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come.

In 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs.[40] Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year,[41] giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves[42] from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating ""The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it."".[43]

Tricky also released his debut solo album, Maxinquaye in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on Maxinquaye featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy's 1988 song ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead.[44] Through his collaborations with Björk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base.

Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.[45]

After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle,[49]Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term ""post-trip hop"" was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person.[50]

Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey,[51]How to Destroy Angels,[52]Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, The xx and Deftones.[53] Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess also displayed a trip hop influence.[54][importance of example(s)?] Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson,[55]Kylie Minogue,[56]Madonna,[57][58]Björk,[59][60][61] and Radiohead,[62] have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres,[63] including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop).

Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album Perdition City. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P's Def Jux Label.[64]Zero 7's album Simple Things, and in particular, its lead single ""Destiny"", was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity.[65] In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, Like Drawing Blood. The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop.[66] Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence.[67][68] Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.[69]

During the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the ""electronica"" label. Trip hop songs were featured in film soundtracks of this era such as the Matrix series. Many producers who were not explicitly trip-hop artists also displayed its influence during this time. Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop. His 2000 album Deltron 3030[70] was a concept album about a rapper from the future, portrayed by Del the Funky Homosapien. 2001 saw the release of his side project, Lovage and the album Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By,[71] with special guests Mike Patton, Prince Paul, Maseo, Damon Albarn, and Afrika Bambaataa. British producer Fatboy Slim's breakthrough album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars,[72] was his most commercially successful release.[importance of example(s)?] Another heavily trip-hop influenced band, Elsiane, published their first album Hybrid in 2007, creating a ""mellow, hypnotic atmosphere utilized in the ’90s by big names like Massive Attack, Portishead, etc.""[73]

Major notable trip hop releases from 2010s include Massive Attack's Heligoland, their first studio album in seven years; and Dutch's A Bright Cold Day in 2010, the latter group including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind.[74][75]

DJ Shadow's The Less You Know, the Better was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010.[76] The album was met with ""generally favorable reviews"" on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow's lack of originality. Sam Richards of NME felt that the album sounded ""like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.""

Beak's album titled Beak>> was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from NME and Spin magazine.[77]

Lana Del Rey released her second album, Born to Die in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads.[78] The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.[79]

Following the 2013 release of EP2, the music of FKA Twigs was described in a Pitchfork Magazine article as ""trip hop for a new time"", with ""a menacing undertow reminiscent of Massive Attack's Mezzanine.""[80]"
"Disco","

Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States' urban nightlife scene. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, brass and horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.

Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular among African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, gay Americans, and Italian Americans[5] in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s to early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the 1960s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of 70s disco's popularity in the United States, including ""the Bump"", ""the Hustle"", ""the Watergate"", and ""the Busstop"".[6]

In the course of the 1970s, disco music was developed further, mainly by artists from the United States and Europe. Well-known artists included the Bee Gees, ABBA, Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Giorgio Moroder, Baccara, The Jacksons, Michael Jackson, Boney M., Earth Wind & Fire, Chaka Khan, Chic, KC and the Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Sister Sledge, Sylvester, The Trammps, Barry White, Diana Ross, Kool & the Gang, and the Village People.[7][8] While performers garnered public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in Manhattan, a venue popular among celebrities. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, consisting predominantly of loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and quaaludes, the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed ""disco biscuits"". Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history. Films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Thank God It's Friday (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.

Disco declined as a major trend in popular music in the United States following the infamous Disco Demolition Night on July 12, 1979, and it continued to sharply decline in popularity in the U.S. during the early 1980s; however, it remained popular in Italy and some European countries throughout the 1980s, and during this time also started becoming trendy in places elsewhere including India[9] and the Middle East,[10] where aspects of disco were blended with regional folk styles such as ghazals and belly dancing. Disco would eventually become a key influence in the development of electronic dance music, house music, hip hop, new wave, dance-punk, and post-disco. The style has had several revivals since the 1990s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. A revival has been underway since the early 2010s, coming to great popularity in the early 2020s. Albums that have contributed to this revival include Confessions on a Dance Floor, Random Access Memories, Future Nostalgia, and Kylie Minogue's album itself titled Disco.[11][12][13][14]

The term ""disco"" is shorthand for the word discothèque, a French word for ""library of phonograph records"" derived from ""bibliothèque"". The word ""discotheque"" had the same meaning in English in the 1950s. ""Discothèque"" became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris, after they had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960, it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines Discotheque as ""A dance hall, nightclub, or similar venue where recorded music is played for dancing, typically equipped with a large dance floor, an elaborate system of flashing coloured lights, and a powerful amplified sound system. "". Its earliest example is use as the name of a particular venue in 1952, and other examples date from 1960 onwards. The entry is annotated as ""Now somewhat dated"".[15] It defines Disco as ""A genre of strongly rhythmical pop music mainly intended for dancing in nightclubs and particularly popular in the mid to late 1970s."", with use from 1975 onwards, describing the origin of the word as a shortened form of discotheque.[16] a

In the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called the ""discotheque dress"" was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form ""disco"" described this dress and has been found in The Salt Lake Tribune on July 12, 1964; Playboy magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.[17]

Vince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the feature article ""Discotheque Rock Paaaaarty"" that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in September 1973.[18][19][20]

The music typically layered soaring, often-reverberated vocals, often doubled by horns,[citation needed] over a background ""pad"" of electric pianos and ""chicken-scratch"" rhythm guitars played on an electric guitar. Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock. ""The ""rooster scratch"" sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge.""[21] Other backing keyboard instruments include the piano, electric organ (during early years), string synthesizers, and electromechanical keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes electric piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Donna Summer's 1977 song ""I Feel Love"", produced by Giorgio Moroder with a prominent Moog synthesizer on the beat, was one of the first disco tracks to use the synthesizer.[22]

The rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of broken octaves, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the bass guitar and by drummers using a drum kit, African/Latin percussion, and electronic drums such as Simmons and Roland drum modules. Philly dance and Salsoul disco the sound was enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as violin, viola, cello, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, flugelhorn, French horn, English horn, oboe, flute, timpani and synth strings, string section or a full string orchestra.[citation needed]

Most disco songs have a steady four-on-the-floor beat set by a bass drum, a quaver or semi-quaver hi-hat pattern with an open hissing hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line.[23][24] A recording error in the 1975 song ""Bad Luck"" by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes where Earl Young's hi-hat was too loud in the recording is said to have established loud hi-hats in disco.[23] Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin polyrhythms, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.

Songs often use syncopation, which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass drum hits four to the floor, at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure).[citation needed] Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.

The orchestral sound usually known as ""disco sound"" relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background ""pad"" sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich ""wall of sound"". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation.

Harmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords,[citation needed] which are found more often in jazz than pop music.

The ""disco sound"" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of funk, soul music of the late 1960s or the small jazz organ trios, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a horn section, a string orchestra, and a variety of ""classical"" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).

Disco songs were arranged and composed by experienced arrangers and orchestrators, and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using multitrack recording techniques and effects units. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a conductor, copyists, record producers, and mixing engineers. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process because disco songs used as many as 64 tracks of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and breaks. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the ""disco sound"" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated disco mix.

Early records were the ""standard"" three-minute version until Tom Moulton came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl singles of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five minutes of good-quality music. With the help of José Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10"" disc instead of 7"". They cut the next single on a 12"" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. 12"" single records, also known as ""Maxi singles"", quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.[25]

By the late 1970s, most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were most notably in New York City but also in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, D.C. The scene was centered on discotheques, nightclubs and private loft parties.

In the 1970s, notable discos included ""Crisco Disco"", ""The Sanctuary"", ""Leviticus"", ""Studio 54"", and ""Paradise Garage"" in New York, ""Artemis"" in Philadelphia, ""Studio One"" in Los Angeles, ""Dugan's Bistro"" in Chicago, and ""The Library"" in Atlanta.[26][27]

In the late '70s, Studio 54 in Midtown Manhattan was arguably the best-known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture in general. It was operated by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager and was notorious for the hedonism that went on within: the balconies were known for sexual encounters and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the ""Man in the Moon"" that included an animated cocaine spoon.

The ""Copacabana"", another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a Barry Manilow song of the same name.

In Washington, D.C., large disco clubs such as ""The Pier"" (""Pier 9"") and ""The Other Side"", originally regarded exclusively as ""gay bars"", became particularly popular among the capital area's gay and straight college students in the late '70s.

By 1979 there were 15,000-20,000 disco nightclubs in the US, many of them opening in suburban shopping centers, hotels, and restaurants. The 2001 Club franchises were the most prolific chain of disco clubs in the country.[28] Although many other attempts were made to franchise disco clubs, 2001 was the only one to successfully do so in this time frame.[29]

Powerful, bass-heavy, hi-fi sound systems were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. ""[Loft-party host David] Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of subwoofers positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade sound engineers such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.""[30]

Typical lighting designs for disco dance floors include multi-colored lights that swirl around or flash to the beat, strobe lights, an illuminated dance floor, and a mirror ball.

Disco-era disc jockeys (DJs) would often remix existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines, and add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a DJ mixer and using a microphone to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as reverb, equalization, and echo effects unit. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include Francis Grasso of The Sanctuary, David Mancuso of The Loft, Frankie Knuckles of the Chicago Warehouse, Larry Levan of the Paradise Garage, Nicky Siano, Walter Gibbons, Karen Mixon Cook, Jim Burgess, John ""Jellybean"" Benitez, Richie Kulala of Studio 54, and Rick Salsalini.

Some DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the recording studio. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific record producer as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in the nightclubs, DJs were also influential in the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.

In the early years, dancers in discos danced in a ""hang loose"" or ""freestyle"" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the ""Bump"", ""Penguin"", ""Boogaloo"", ""Watergate"", and ""Robot"". By October 1975 the Hustle reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated, and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, New York Hustle, and Latin Hustle.[27]

During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ""touch dancing"", ""the hustle"", and ""the cha cha"". The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner, and line dances. The book topped the New York Times bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German, and French.

In Chicago, the Step By Step disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that Don Cornelius used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, Soul Train, Step by Step's audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show aired on Saturday mornings and had a strong following. Its viewers would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as ""Disco Night at White Sox Park"".

In Sacramento, California, Disco King Paul Dale Roberts danced for the Guinness Book of World Records. He danced for 205 hours, the equivalent of 8½ days. Other dance marathons took place afterward and Roberts held the world record for disco dancing for a short period of time.[31]

Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included Pan's People and Hot Gossip. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film Saturday Night Fever (1977). Further influence came from the music and dance style of such films as Fame (1980), Disco Dancer (1982), Flashdance (1983), and The Last Days of Disco (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as Dance Fever (1979).

Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore glamorous, expensive, and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as Halston dresses, or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless halter tops, disco pants, ""hot pants"", or body-hugging spandex bodywear or ""catsuits"".[32] Men would wear shiny polyester Qiana shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore Pierre Cardin suits, three piece suits with a vest, and double-knit polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted to some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom while the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style, to permit freedom of movement.[32]

During the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, activities that would have been considered ""feminine"" according to the gender stereotypes of the era.[32] Women dancers wore glitter makeup, sequins, or gold lamé clothing that would shimmer under the lights.[32] Bold colors were popular for both genders. Platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear.[32]Necklaces and medallions were a common fashion accessory. Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in drag, covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups were more likely to be seen at invitation-only New York City loft parties and disco clubs.[32]

In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving club drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud, bass-heavy music and the flashing colored lights, such as cocaine[33] (nicknamed ""blow""), amyl nitrite (""poppers""),[34] and the ""... other quintessential 1970s club drug Quaalude, which suspended motor coordination and gave the sensation that one's arms and legs had turned to 'Jell-O.'""[35] Quaaludes were so popular at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed ""disco biscuits"".[36]

Paul Gootenberg states that ""[t]he relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough...""[33] During the 1970s, the use of cocaine by well-to-do celebrities led to its ""glamorization"" and to the widely held view that it was a ""soft drug"".[37]LSD, marijuana, and ""speed"" (amphetamines) were also popular in disco clubs, and the use of these drugs ""...contributed to the hedonistic quality of the dance floor experience.""[38] Since disco dances were typically held in liquor licensed-nightclubs and dance clubs, alcoholic drinks were also consumed by dancers; some users intentionally combined alcohol with the consumption of other drugs, such as Quaaludes, for a stronger effect.

According to Peter Braunstein, the ""massive quantities of drugs ingested in discothèques produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out.""[35] At The Saint nightclub, a high percentage of the gay male dancers and patrons would have sex in the club; they typically had unprotected sex, because in 1980, HIV-AIDS had not yet been identified.[39] At The Saint, ""dancers would elope to an unpoliced upstairs balcony to engage in sex.""[39] The promiscuity and public sex at discos was part of a broader trend towards exploring a freer sexual expression in the 1970s, an era that is also associated with ""swingers clubs, hot tubs, [and] key parties.""[40]

In his paper, ""In Defense of Disco"" (1979), Richard Dyer claims eroticism as one of the three main characteristics of disco.[41] As opposed to rock music which has a very phallic centered eroticism focusing on the sexual pleasure of men over other persons, Dyer describes disco as featuring a non-phallic full body eroticism.[41] Through a range of percussion instruments, a willingness to play with rhythm, and the endless repeating of phrases without cutting the listener off, disco achieved this full-body eroticism by restoring eroticism to the whole body for both sexes.[41] This allowed for the potential expression of sexualities not defined by the cock/penis, and the erotic pleasure of bodies that are not defined by a relationship to a penis.[41] The sexual liberation expressed through the rhythm of disco is further represented in the club spaces that disco grew within.

In Peter Shapiro's Modulations: A History of Electronic Music: Throbbing Words on Sound, he discusses eroticism through the technology disco utilizes to create its audacious sound.[42] The music, Shapiro states, is adjunct to ""the pleasure-is-politics ethos of post-Stonewall culture."" He explains how ""mechano-eroticism"", which links the technology used to create the unique mechanical sound of disco to eroticism, set the genre in a new dimension of reality living outside of naturalism and heterosexuality. Randy Jones and Mark Jacobsen echo this sentiment in BBC Radio's ""The Politics of Dancing: How Disco Changed the World,"" describing the loose, hip-focused dance style as ""a new kind of communion"" that celebrates the sparks of liberation brought on the Stonewall riots.[43] As New York state had laws against homosexual behavior in public, including dancing with a member of the same sex, the eroticism of disco served as resistance and an expression of sexual freedom.[44]

He uses Donna Summer's singles ""Love to Love You Baby"" (1975) and ""I Feel Love"" (1977) as examples of the ever-present relationship between the synthesized bass lines and backgrounds to the simulated sounds of orgasms. Summer's voice echoes in the tracks, and likens them to the drug-fervent, sexually liberated fans of disco who sought to free themselves through disco's ""aesthetic of machine sex.""[45] Shapiro sees this as an influence that creates sub-genres like hi-NRG and dub-disco, which allowed for eroticism and technology to be further explored through intense synth bass lines and alternative rhythmic techniques that tap into the entire body rather than the obvious erotic parts of the body.

The New York nightclub The Sanctuary under resident DJ Francis Grasso is a prime example of this sexual liberty. In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as ""poured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality.""[46] The Sanctuary was the ""first totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America"" and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, bathrooms. and hallways of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy-like sexual engagements.[46]

By describing the music, drugs, and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex, and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. It supports the argument that disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. The recent legalization of abortion and the introduction of antibiotics and the pill facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment. Thus was fostered a very sex-positive framework around discotheques.[47]

Further, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as an illness.[46] This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. David Mancuso's club/house party, The Loft, was described as having a ""pansexual attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually carried bail money with them.""[48]

Disco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band. The first discotheques mostly played swing music. Later on, uptempo rhythm and blues became popular in American clubs and northern soul and glam rock records in the UK. In the early 1940s, nightclubs in Paris resorted to playing jazz records during the Nazi occupation.

Régine Zylberberg claimed to have started the first discotheque and to have been the first club DJ in 1953 in the ""Whisky à Go-Go"" in Paris. She installed a dance floor with colored lights and two turntables so she could play records without having a gap in the music.[49] In October 1959, the owner of the Scotch Club in Aachen, West Germany chose to install a record player for the opening night instead of hiring a live band. The patrons were unimpressed until a young reporter, who happened to be covering the opening of the club, impulsively took control of the record player and introduced the records that he chose to play. Klaus Quirini later claimed to thus have been the world's first nightclub DJ.[17]

During the 1960s, discotheque dancing became a European trend that was enthusiastically picked up by the American press.[17] At this time, when the discotheque culture from Europe became popular in the United States, several music genres with danceable rhythms rose to popularity and evolved into different sub-genres: rhythm and blues (originated in the 1940s), soul (late 1950s and 1960s), funk (mid-1960s) and go-go (mid-1960s and 1970s; more than ""disco"", the word ""go-go"" originally indicated a music club). Musical genres that were primarily performed by African-American musicians would influence much of early disco.

Also during the 1960s, the Motown record label developed its own approach, described as having ""1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were half way between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio.""[50] Motown had many hits with disco elements by acts like Eddie Kendricks (""Keep on Truckin'"" in 1973,[51] ""Boogie Down"" in 1974).

At the end of the 1960s, musicians, and audiences from the Black, Italian, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippie and psychedelia subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs.[52][53][54] In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like MFSB's album Love Is the Message.[52][55]
Partly through the success of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelic elements that were popular in rock music of the late 1960s found their way into soul and early funk music and formed the subgenre psychedelic soul. Examples can be found in the music of the Chambers Brothers, George Clinton with his Parliament-Funkadelic collective, Sly and the Family Stone, and the productions of Norman Whitfield with The Temptations.

The long instrumental introductions and detailed orchestration found in psychedelic soul tracks by the Temptations are also considered as cinematic soul. In the early 1970s, Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes scored hits with cinematic soul songs that were actually composed for movie soundtracks: ""Superfly"" (1972) and ""Theme from Shaft"" (1971). The latter is sometimes regarded as an early disco song.[56] From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Philadelphia soul and New York soul developed as sub-genres that also had lavish percussion, lush string orchestra arrangements, and expensive record production processes. In the early 1970s, the Philly soul productions by Gamble and Huff evolved from the simpler arrangements of the late-1960s into a style featuring lush strings, thumping basslines, and sliding hi-hat rhythms. These elements would become typical for disco music and are found in several of the hits they produced in the early 1970s:

Other early disco tracks that helped shape disco and became popular on the dance floors of (underground) discotheque clubs and parties include:

Early disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as Salsoul Records (Ken, Stanley, and Joseph Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter). The genre was also shaped by Tom Moulton, who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs — thus creating the extended mix or ""remix"", going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12"" record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the ""disco sound"" included David Mancuso, Nicky Siano, Shep Pettibone, Larry Levan, Walter Gibbons, and Chicago-based Frankie Knuckles. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.

Disco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show Soul Train in 1971 hosted by Don Cornelius, then Marty Angelo's Disco Step-by-Step Television Show in 1975, Steve Marcus's Disco Magic/Disco 77, Eddie Rivera's Soap Factory, and Merv Griffin's Dance Fever, hosted by Deney Terrio, who is credited with teaching actor John Travolta to dance for his role in the film Saturday Night Fever (1977), as well as DANCE, based out of Columbia, South Carolina.

In 1974, New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.[59]

In the 1970s, the key counterculture of the 1960s, the hippie movement, was fading away. The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation, and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of race riots, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, and the Watergate scandal, left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless [citation needed]. The start of the '70s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues.[60] The non-partnered dance style of disco music allowed people of all races and sexual orientations to enjoy the dancefloor atmosphere.[61]

In Beautiful Things in Popular Culture, Simon Frith highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. ""The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie"", he says. ""The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.""[62]

The birth of disco is often claimed to be found in the private dance parties held by New York City DJ David Mancuso's home that became known as The Loft, an invitation-only non-commercial underground club that inspired many others.[20] He organized the first major party in his Manhattan home on Valentine's Day 1970 with the name ""Love Saves The Day"". After some months the parties became weekly events and Mancuso continued to give regular parties into the 1990s.[63] Mancuso required that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.[48]

When Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the gay community (which made up much of The Loft's attendee roster) was often harassed in the gay bars and dance clubs, with many gay men carrying bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private discotheques, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, policies. Vince Aletti described it ""like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else,"" and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying ""It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music.""[48]

Film critic Roger Ebert called the popular embrace of disco's exuberant dance moves an escape from ""the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies.""[64]Pauline Kael, writing about the disco-themed film Saturday Night Fever, said the film and disco itself touched on ""something deeply romantic, the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you'd like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary.""[65]

In the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British mod scene and formed the northern soul movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent), and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks, and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony & the Imperials and Jackie Wilson.

In 1974, there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events. Glam rock tracks were popular, with, for example, Gary Glitter's 1972 single ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" becoming popular on UK dance floors while it did not get much radio airplay.[66]

From 1974 to 1977, disco music increased in popularity as many disco songs topped the charts. The Hues Corporation's ""Rock the Boat"" (1974), a US number-one single and million-seller, was one of the early disco songs to reach number one. The same year saw the release of ""Kung Fu Fighting"", performed by Carl Douglas and produced by Biddu, which reached number one in both the UK and US, and became the best-selling single of the year[67] and one of the best-selling singles of all time with 11 million records sold worldwide,[68][69] helping to popularize disco to a great extent.[68] Another notable disco success that year was George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"":[70] it became the United Kingdom's first number one disco single.[71][70]

In the northwestern sections of the United Kingdom, the northern soul explosion, which started in the late 1960s and peaked in 1974, made the region receptive to disco, which the region's disc jockeys were bringing back from New York City. The shift by some DJs to the newer sounds coming from the U.S. resulted in a split in the scene, whereby some abandoned the 1960s soul and pushed a modern soul sound which tended to be more closely aligned with disco than soul.

In 1975, Gloria Gaynor released her first side-long vinyl album, which included a remake of the Jackson 5's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" (which, in fact, is also the album title) and two other songs, ""Honey Bee"" and her disco version of ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)"". The album first topped the Billboard disco/dance charts in November 1974. Later in 1978, Gaynor's number-one disco song was ""I Will Survive"", which was seen as a symbol of female strength and a gay anthem,[72] like her further disco hit, a 1983 remake of ""I Am What I Am"". In 1979 she released ""Let Me Know (I Have a Right)"", a single which gained popularity in the civil rights movements. Also in 1975, Vincent Montana Jr.'s Salsoul Orchestra contributed with their Latin-flavored orchestral dance song ""Salsoul Hustle"", reaching number four on the Billboard Dance Chart; their 1976 hits were ""Tangerine"" and ""Nice 'n' Naasty"", the first being a cover of a 1941 song.[citation needed]

Songs such as Van McCoy's 1975 ""The Hustle"" and the humorous Joe Tex 1977 ""Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)"" gave names to the popular disco dances ""the Bump"" and ""the Hustle"". Other notable early successful disco songs include Barry White's ""You're the First, the Last, My Everything"" (1974); Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"" (1974)'; Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes' ""Get Dancin'"" (1974); Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Shining Star"" (1975); Silver Convention's ""Fly, Robin, Fly"" (1975) and ""Get Up and Boogie"" (1976); Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn the Beat Around"" (1976); and ""More, More, More"" (1976) by Andrea True (a former pornographic actress during the Golden Age of Porn, an era largely contemporaneous with the height of disco).

Formed by Harry Wayne Casey (a.k.a. ""KC"") and Richard Finch, Miami's KC and the Sunshine Band had a string of disco-definitive top-five singles between 1975 and 1977, including ""Get Down Tonight"", ""That's the Way (I Like It)"", ""(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty"", ""I'm Your Boogie Man"", ""Boogie Shoes"", and ""Keep It Comin' Love"". In this period, rock bands like the English Electric Light Orchestra featured in their songs a violin sound that became a staple of disco music, as in the 1975 hit ""Evil Woman"", although the genre was correctly described as orchestral rock.

Other disco producers such as Tom Moulton took ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the ""four on the floor"" style that dominated. DJ Larry Levan utilized styles from dub and jazz and remixing techniques to create early versions of house music that sparked the genre.[73]

Norman Whitfield was an influential producer and songwriter at Motown records, renowned for creating innovative ""psychedelic soul"" songs with many hits for Marvin Gaye, the Velvelettes, the Temptations, and Gladys Knight & the Pips. From around the production of the Temptations album Cloud Nine in 1968, he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer, dance-friendly tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. An example of such a long psychedelic soul track is ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"", which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12"" version in 1972. By the early 70s, many of Whitfield's productions evolved more and more towards funk and disco, as heard on albums by the Undisputed Truth and the 1973 album G.I.T.: Get It Together by The Jackson 5. The Undisputed Truth, a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"". Their disco single ""You + Me = Love"" (number 43) was produced by Whitfield and made number 2 on the US dance chart in 1976.

In 1975, Whitfield left Motown and founded his own label Whitfield records, on which also ""You + Me = Love"" was released. Whitfield produced some more disco hits, including ""Car Wash"" (1976) by Rose Royce from the album soundtrack to the 1976 film Car Wash. In 1977, singer, songwriter, and producer Willie Hutch, who had been signed to Motown since 1970, now signed with Whitfield's new label, and scored a successful disco single with his song ""In and Out"" in 1982.

Other Motown artists turned to disco as well. Diana Ross embraced the disco sound with her successful 1976 outing ""Love Hangover"" from her self-titled album. Her 1980 dance classics ""Upside Down"" and ""I'm Coming Out"" were written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the group Chic. The Supremes, the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976's ""I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking"" and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's ""You're My Driving Wheel"".

At the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, Marvin Gaye released ""Got to Give It Up"" in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye's songs have disco elements, including ""I Want You"" (1975). Stevie Wonder released the disco single ""Sir Duke"" in 1977 as a tribute to Duke Ellington, the influential jazz legend who had died in 1974. Smokey Robinson left the Motown group the Miracles for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album A Quiet Storm in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the ""Quiet Storm"" musical programming format and subgenre of R&B. It contained the disco single ""Baby That's Backatcha"". Other Motown artists who scored disco hits were Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with ""Love Machine"" (1975), Eddie Kendricks with ""Keep On Truckin'"" (1973), the Originals with ""Down to Love Town"" (1976), and Thelma Houston with her cover of the Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" (1976). The label continued to release successful songs into the 1980s with Rick James's ""Super Freak"" (1981), and the Commodores' ""Lady (You Bring Me Up)"" (1981).

Several of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. Mary Wells, Motown's first female superstar with her signature song ""My Guy"" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song ""Gigolo"" in 1980. Jimmy Ruffin, the elder brother of the Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, was also signed to Motown and released his most successful and well-known song ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song ""Hold On (To My Love)"", which was written and produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, for his album Sunrise. Edwin Starr, known for his Motown protest song ""War"" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, ""Contact"" and ""H.A.P.P.Y. Radio"". Kiki Dee became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, Great Expectations (1970), and two singles ""The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday"" (1970) and ""Love Makes the World Go Round"" (1971), the latter giving her first-ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with Elton John's The Rocket Record Company, and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston.

Many Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. The Jackson 5, one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s, left the record company in 1975 (Jermaine Jackson, however, remained with the label) after successful songs like ""I Want You Back"" (1969) and ""ABC"" (1970), and even the disco song ""Dancing Machine"" (1974). Renamed as 'the Jacksons' (as Motown owned the name 'the Jackson 5'), they went on to find success with disco songs like ""Blame It on the Boogie"" (1978), ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" (1979), and ""Can You Feel It?"" (1981) on the Epic label.

The Isley Brothers, whose short tenure at the company had produced the song ""This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)"" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like ""It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)"" (1979). Gladys Knight & the Pips, who recorded the most successful version of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as ""Baby, Don't Change Your Mind"" (1977) and ""Bourgie, Bourgie"" (1980) in the disco era. The Detroit Spinners were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song ""It's a Shame"" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow Detroit native Aretha Franklin, to Atlantic Records, and there had disco songs like ""The Rubberband Man"" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's ""Are You Ready for Love"", as well as a medley of the Four Seasons' song ""Working My Way Back to You"" and Michael Zager's ""Forgive Me, Girl"". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, Chameleon (1972) – to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, ""The Night"", was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the Northern Soul circuit, reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song ""December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)"" (1975) for Warner Curb Records.

By far the most successful Euro disco act was ABBA (1972–1982). This Swedish quartet, which sang primarily in English, found success with singles such as ""Waterloo"" (1974), ""Take a Chance on Me"" (1978), ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"" (1979), ""Super Trouper"" (1980), and their signature smash hit ""Dancing Queen"" (1976).

In the 1970s Munich, West Germany, music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte made a decisive contribution to disco music with a string of hits for Donna Summer, which became known as the ""Munich Sound"".[75] In 1975, Summer suggested the lyric ""Love to Love You Baby"" to Moroder and Bellotte, who turned the lyric into a full disco song. The final product, which contained the vocalizations of a series of simulated orgasms, initially was not intended for release, but when Moroder played it in the clubs it caused a sensation and he released it. The song became an international hit, reaching the charts in many European countries and the US (No. 2). It has been described as the arrival of the expression of raw female sexual desire in pop music. A nearly 17-minute 12-inch single was released. The 12"" single became and remains a standard in discos today.[76][77] In 1976 Donna Summer's version of ""Could It Be Magic"" brought disco further into the mainstream. In 1977 Summer, Moroder and Bellotte further released ""I Feel Love"", as the B-side of ""Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)"", which revolutionized dance music with its mostly electronic production and was a massive worldwide success, spawning the Hi-NRG subgenre.[76] Giorgio Moroder was described by AllMusic as ""one of the principal architects of the disco sound"".[78] Another successful disco music project by Moroder at that time was Munich Machine (1976–1980).

Boney M. (1974–1986) was a West German Euro disco group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by record producer Frank Farian. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as ""Daddy Cool"" (1976) ""Ma Baker"" (1977) and ""Rivers Of Babylon"" (1978). Another successful West German Euro disco recording act was Silver Convention (1974–1979). The German group Kraftwerk also had an influence on Euro disco.

In France, Dalida released ""J'attendrai"" (""I Will Wait"") in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe, and Japan. Dalida successfully adjusted herself to disco and released at least a dozen of songs that charted in the top 10 in Europe. Claude François, who re-invented himself as the ""king of French disco"", released ""La plus belle chose du monde"", a French version of the Bee Gees song ""Massachusetts"", which became successful in Canada and Europe and ""Alexandrie Alexandra"" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. Cerrone's early songs, ""Love in C Minor"" (1976), ""Supernature"" (1977), and ""Give Me Love"" (1978) were successful in the US and Europe. Another Euro disco act was the French diva Amanda Lear, where Euro disco sound is most heard in ""Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)"" (1978). French producer Alec Costandinos assembled the Euro disco group Love and Kisses (1977–1982).

In Italy Raffaella Carrà was the most successful Euro disco act, alongside La Bionda, Hermanas Goggi and Oliver Onions. Her greatest international single was ""Tanti Auguri"" (""Best Wishes""), which has become a popular song with gay audiences. The song is also known under its Spanish title ""Para hacer bien el amor hay que venir al sur"" (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song ""Jätke võtmed väljapoole"" was performed by Anne Veski. ""A far l'amore comincia tu"" (""To make love, your move first"") was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as ""En el amor todo es empezar"", in German as ""Liebelei"", in French as ""Puisque tu l'aimes dis le lui"", and in English as ""Do It, Do It Again"". It was her only entry to the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 9, where she remains a one-hit wonder.[79] In 1977, she recorded another successful single, ""Fiesta"" (""The Party"" in English) originally in Spanish, but then recorded it in French and Italian after the song hit the charts. ""A far l'amore comincia tu"" has also been covered in Turkish by a Turkish popstar Ajda Pekkan as ""Sakın Ha"" in 1977.

Recently, Carrà has gained new attention for her appearance as the female dancing soloist in a 1974 TV performance of the experimental gibberish song ""Prisencolinensinainciusol"" (1973) by Adriano Celentano.[80] A remixed video featuring her dancing went viral on the internet in 2008.[81][citation needed] In 2008 a video of a performance of her only successful UK single, ""Do It, Do It Again"", was featured in the Doctor Who episode ""Midnight"". Rafaella Carrà worked with Bob Sinclar on the new single ""Far l'Amore"" which was released on YouTube on March 17, 2011. The song charted in different European countries.[82] Another prominent European disco act was the pop group Luv' from the Netherlands.

Euro disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene, even when disco's popularity sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major U.S. record labels and producers.[83] Through the influence of Italo disco, it also played a role in the evolution of early house music in the early 1980s and later forms of electronic dance music, including early '90s Eurodance.

In December 1977, the film Saturday Night Fever was released. It was a huge success and its soundtrack became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The idea for the film was sparked by a 1976 New York magazine[84] article titled ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"" which supposedly chronicled the disco culture in mid-1970s New York City, but was later revealed to have been fabricated.[85] Some critics said the film ""mainstreamed"" disco, making it more acceptable to heterosexual white males.[86] Many music historians believe the success of the movie and soundtrack extended the life of the disco era by several years.

Organized around the culture of suburban discotheques and the character of Tony Manero, portrayed by John Travolta, Saturday Night Fever became a cultural phenomenon that recast the dance floor as a site for patriarchal masculinity and heterosexual courtship. This transformation aligned disco with the interests of the perceived mass market, specifically targeting suburban and Middle American audiences.[61]

The portrayal of the dance floor in Saturday Night Fever marked a reappropriation by straight male culture, turning it into a space for men to showcase their prowess and pursue partners of the opposite sex. The film popularized the hustle, a Latin social dance, reinforcing the centrality of the straight-dancing couple in the disco exchange. Notably, the soundtrack, dominated by the Bee Gees, risked presenting disco as a new incarnation of shrill white pop, deviating from its diverse and inclusive origins.[61] The success of Saturday Night Fever was unprecedented, breaking box office and album sale records. Unfortunately, its impact went beyond mere popularity. The film established a template for disco that was easily reproducible, yet thoroughly de-queered in its outlook. By narrowing the narrative to fit into the conventional ideals of suburban heterosexual culture, the film contributed to a distorted and commodified version of disco.

The Bee Gees used Barry Gibb's falsetto to garner hits such as ""You Should Be Dancing"", ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""More Than A Woman"", ""Love You Inside Out"", and ""Tragedy"". Andy Gibb, a younger brother to the Bee Gees, followed with similarly styled solo singles such as ""I Just Want to Be Your Everything"", ""(Love Is) Thicker Than Water"", and ""Shadow Dancing"".

In 1978, Donna Summer's multi-million-selling vinyl single disco version of ""MacArthur Park"" was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for three weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The recording, which was included as part of the ""MacArthur Park Suite"" on her double live album Live and More, was eight minutes and 40 seconds long on the album. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version of MacArthur Park was Summer's first single to reach number one on the Hot 100; it does not include the balladic second movement of the song, however. A 2013 remix of ""MacArthur Park"" by Summer topped the Billboard Dance Charts marking five consecutive decades with a number-one song on the charts.[87] From mid-1978 to late 1979, Summer continued to release singles such as ""Last Dance"", ""Heaven Knows"" (with Brooklyn Dreams), ""Hot Stuff"", ""Bad Girls"", ""Dim All the Lights"" and ""On the Radio"", all very successful songs, landing in the top five or better, on the Billboard pop charts.

The band Chic was formed mainly by guitarist Nile Rodgers—a self-described ""street hippie"" from late 1960s New York—and bassist Bernard Edwards. Their popular 1978 single, ""Le Freak"", is regarded as an iconic song of the genre. Other successful songs by Chic include the often-sampled ""Good Times"" (1979), ""I Want Your Love"" (1979), and ""Everybody Dance"" (1979). The group regarded themselves as the disco movement's rock band that made good on the hippie movement's ideals of peace, love, and freedom. Every song they wrote was written with an eye toward giving it ""deep hidden meaning"" or D.H.M.[88]

Sylvester, a flamboyant and openly gay singer famous for his soaring falsetto voice, scored his biggest disco hit in late 1978 with ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"". His singing style was said to have influenced the singer Prince. At that time, disco was one of the forms of music most open to gay performers.[89]

The Village People were a singing/dancing group created by Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo to target disco's gay audience. They were known for their onstage costumes of typically male-associated jobs and ethnic minorities and achieved mainstream success with their 1978 hit song ""Macho Man"". Other songs include ""Y.M.C.A."" (1979) and ""In the Navy"" (1979).

Also noteworthy are The Trammps' ""Disco Inferno"" (1976), (1978, reissue due to the popularity gained from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack), Heatwave's ""Boogie Nights"" (1977), Evelyn ""Champagne"" King's ""Shame"" (1977), A Taste of Honey's ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"" (1978), Cheryl Lynn's ""Got to Be Real"" (1978), Alicia Bridges's ""I Love the Nightlife"" (1978), Patrick Hernandez's ""Born to Be Alive"" (1978), Earth, Wind & Fire's ""September"" (1978) and ""Boogie Wonderland"" (1979),  Peaches & Herb's ""Shake Your Groove Thing"" (1978), Sister Sledge's ""We Are Family"" and ""He's the Greatest Dancer"" (both 1979), McFadden and Whitehead's ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now"" (1979), Anita Ward's ""Ring My Bell"" (1979), Kool & the Gang's ""Ladies' Night"" (1979) and ""Celebration"" (1980), The Whispers's ""And the Beat Goes On"" (1979), Stephanie Mills's ""What Cha Gonna Do with My Lovin'"" (1979), Lipps Inc.'s ""Funkytown"" (1980), The Brothers Johnson's ""Stomp!"" (1980), George Benson's ""Give Me the Night"" (1980), Donna Summer's ""Sunset People"" (1980), and Walter Murphy's various attempts to bring classical music to the mainstream, most notably the disco song ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" (1976), which was inspired by Beethoven's fifth symphony.

At the height of its popularity, many non-disco artists recorded songs with disco elements, such as Rod Stewart with his ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" in 1979.[90] Even mainstream rock artists adopted elements of disco. Progressive rock group Pink Floyd used disco-like drums and guitar in their song ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"" (1979),[91] which became their only number-one single in both the US and UK. The Eagles referenced disco with ""One of These Nights"" (1975)[92] and ""Disco Strangler"" (1979), Paul McCartney & Wings with ""Silly Love Songs"" (1976) and ""Goodnight Tonight"" (1979), Queen with ""Another One Bites the Dust"" (1980), the Rolling Stones with ""Miss You"" (1978) and ""Emotional Rescue"" (1980), Stephen Stills with his album Thoroughfare Gap (1978), Electric Light Orchestra with ""Shine a Little Love"" and ""Last Train to London"" (both 1979), Chicago with ""Street Player"" (1979), the Kinks with ""(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman"" (1979), the Grateful Dead with ""Shakedown Street"", The Who with ""Eminence Front"" (1982), and the J. Geils Band with ""Come Back"" (1980). Even hard rock group KISS jumped in with ""I Was Made for Lovin' You"" (1979),[93] and Ringo Starr's album Ringo the 4th (1978) features a strong disco influence.

The disco sound was also adopted by artists from other genres, including the 1979 U.S. number one hit ""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"" by easy listening singer Barbra Streisand in a duet with Donna Summer. In country music, in an attempt to appeal to the more mainstream market, artists began to add pop/disco influences to their music. Dolly Parton launched a successful crossover onto the pop/dance charts, with her albums Heartbreaker and Great Balls of Fire containing songs with a disco flair. In particular, a disco remix of the track ""Baby I'm Burnin'"" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart; ultimately becoming one of the years biggest club hits.[94]
Additionally, Connie Smith covered Andy Gibb's ""I Just Want to Be Your Everything"" in 1977, Bill Anderson recorded ""Double S"" in 1978, and Ronnie Milsap released ""Get It Up"" and covered blues singer Tommy Tucker's song ""Hi-Heel Sneakers"" in 1979.

Pre-existing non-disco songs, standards, and TV themes were frequently ""disco-ized"" in the 1970s, such as the I Love Lucy theme (recorded as ""Disco Lucy"" by the Wilton Place Street Band), ""Aquarela do Brasil"" (recorded as ""Brazil"" by The Ritchie Family), and ""Baby Face"" (recorded by the Wing and a Prayer Fife and Drum Corps). The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the big band era—which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big band arrangements, including Perry Como, who re-recorded his 1945 song ""Temptation"", in 1975, as well as Ethel Merman, who released an album of disco songs entitled The Ethel Merman Disco Album in 1979.

Myron Floren, second-in-command on The Lawrence Welk Show, released a recording of the ""Clarinet Polka"" entitled ""Disco Accordion."" Similarly, Bobby Vinton adapted ""The Pennsylvania Polka"" into a song named ""Disco Polka"". Easy listening icon Percy Faith, in one of his last recordings, released an album entitled Disco Party (1975) and recorded a disco version of his ""Theme from A Summer Place"" in 1976. Even classical music was adapted for disco, notably Walter Murphy's ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" (1976, based on the first movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony) and ""Flight 76"" (1976, based on Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Flight of the Bumblebee""), and Louis Clark's Hooked On Classics series of albums and singles.

Many original television theme songs of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as S.W.A.T. (1975), Wonder Woman (1975), Charlie's Angels (1976), NBC Saturday Night At The Movies (1976), The Love Boat (1977), The Donahue Show (1977), CHiPs (1977), The Professionals (1977), Dallas (1978), NBC Sports broadcasts (1978), Kojak (1977), and The Hollywood Squares (1979).

Disco jingles also made their way into many TV commercials, including Purina's 1979 ""Good Mews"" cat food commercial[95] and an ""IC Light"" commercial by Pittsburgh's Iron City Brewing Company.

Several parodies of the disco style were created. Rick Dees, at the time a radio DJ in Memphis, Tennessee, recorded ""Disco Duck"" (1976) and ""Dis-Gorilla"" (1977); Frank Zappa parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in ""Disco Boy"" on his 1976 Zoot Allures album and in ""Dancin' Fool"" on his 1979 Sheik Yerbouti album. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's eponymous 1983 debut album includes a disco song called ""Gotta Boogie"", an extended pun on the similarity of the disco move to the American slang word ""booger"". Comedian Bill Cosby devoted his entire 1977 album Disco Bill to disco parodies. In 1980, Mad Magazine released a flexi-disc titled Mad Disco featuring six full-length parodies of the genre. Rock and roll songs critical of disco included Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" and, especially, the Who's ""Sister Disco"" (both 1978)—although the Who's ""Eminence Front"" (four years later) had a disco feel.

By the end of the 1970s, anti-disco sentiment developed among rock music fans and musicians, particularly in the United States.[96][97] Disco was criticized as mindless, consumerist, overproduced and escapist.[98] The slogans ""Disco sucks"" and ""Death to disco""[96] became common. Rock artists such as Rod Stewart and David Bowie who added disco elements to their music were accused of selling out.[99][100]

The punk subculture in the United States and the United Kingdom was often hostile to disco,[96] although, in the UK, many early Sex Pistols fans such as the Bromley Contingent and Jordan liked disco, often congregating at nightclubs such as Louise's in Soho and the Sombrero in Kensington. The track ""Love Hangover"" by Diana Ross, the house anthem at the former, was cited as a particular favourite by many early UK punks.[101]
The film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and its soundtrack album contained a disco medley of Sex Pistols songs, entitled Black Arabs and credited to a group of the same name.

However, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, in the song ""Saturday Night Holocaust"", likened disco to the cabaret culture of Weimar-era Germany for its apathy towards government policies and its escapism. Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo said that disco was ""like a beautiful woman with a great body and no brains"", and a product of political apathy of that era.[102] New Jersey rock critic Jim Testa wrote ""Put a Bullet Through the Jukebox"", a vitriolic screed attacking disco that was considered a punk call to arms.[103]Steve Hillage, shortly prior to his transformation from a progressive rock musician into an electronic artist at the end of the 1970s with the inspiration of disco, disappointed his rockist fans by admitting his love for disco, with Hillage recalling ""it's like I'd killed their pet cat.""[104]

Anti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show WKRP in Cincinnati was a hostile attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the 1980 comedy film Airplane!, a wayward airplane slices a radio tower with its wing, knocking out an all-disco radio station.[105] July 12, 1979, became known as ""the day disco died"" because of the Disco Demolition Night, an anti-disco demonstration in a baseball double-header at Comiskey Park in Chicago.[106] Rock station DJs Steve Dahl and Garry Meier, along with Michael Veeck, son of Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader which involved exploding disco records in centerfield. As the second game was about to begin, the raucous crowd stormed onto the field and proceeded to set fires and tear out seats and pieces of turf. The Chicago Police Department made numerous arrests, and the extensive damage to the field forced the White Sox to forfeit the second game to the Detroit Tigers, who had won the first game.

Disco's decline in popularity after Disco Demolition Night was rapid. On July 12, 1979, the top six records on the U.S. music charts were disco songs.[107] By September 22, there were no disco songs in the US Top 10 chart, with the exception of Herb Alpert's instrumental ""Rise"", a smooth jazz composition with some disco overtones.[107] Some in the media, in celebratory tones, declared disco ""dead"" and rock revived.[107]Karen Mixon Cook, the first female disco DJ, stated that people still pause every July 12 for a moment of silence in honor of disco. Dahl stated in a 2004 interview that disco was ""probably on its way out [at the time]. But I think it [Disco Demolition Night] hastened its demise"".[108]

The anti-disco movement, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, country music began a slow rise on the pop chart. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie Urban Cowboy. The continued popularity of power pop and the revival of oldies in the late 1970s was also related to disco's decline; the 1978 film Grease was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was John Travolta, who in 1977 had starred in Saturday Night Fever, which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.

During this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, MCA Records purchased ABC Records, absorbed some of its artists and then shut the label down. Midsong International Records ceased operations in 1980. RSO Records founder Robert Stigwood left the label in 1981 and TK Records closed in the same year. Salsoul Records continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand.[109]Casablanca Records had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company PolyGram.

Many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even ones who tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The Bee Gees, for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989's ""One"") and three more top-40 songs (despite completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs), even though numerous songs they wrote and had other artists perform were successful. Chic never hit the top-40 again after ""Good Times"" topped the chart in August 1979. Of the handful of groups not taken down by disco's fall from favor, Kool and the Gang, Donna Summer, the Jacksons, and Gloria Gaynor in particular—stand out. In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on,[110] they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. Earth, Wind & Fire also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s.

Six months prior to Disco Demolition Night (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI (WLS-FM) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that competed against WDAI at the time, WGCI-FM, would later incorporate R&B and pop songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the Chicago house genre to the airwaves.[citation needed]

Factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants.[111] In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the ""Disco sucks"" movement as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.[96][100][106] It was also interpreted being part of a wider cultural ""backlash"", the move towards conservatism,[112] that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president Ronald Reagan in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the United States Senate for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the Religious Right around the same time.

In January 1979, rock critic Robert Christgau argued that homophobia, and most likely racism, were reasons behind the movement,[99] a conclusion seconded by John Rockwell. Craig Werner wrote: ""The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives, and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. Nonetheless, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia.""[113]Legs McNeil, founder of the fanzine Punk, was quoted in an interview as saying, ""the hippies always wanted to be black. We were going, 'fuck the blues, fuck the black experience.'"" He also said that disco was the result of an ""unholy"" union between homosexuals and blacks.[114]

Steve Dahl, who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, ""It's really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it. But we weren't thinking like that,""[100] it was ""just kids pissing on a musical genre"".[115]  It has been noted that British punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist reggae genre as well as the more pro-gay new romantics movement.[96] Christgau and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.[99][103]

In 1979, the music industry in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed. The producer-oriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industry's artist-oriented marketing system.[116] Harold Childs, senior vice president at A&M Records, reportedly told the Los Angeles Times that ""radio is really desperate for rock product"" and ""they're all looking for some white rock-n-roll"".[106]Gloria Gaynor argued that the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight.[117]

Disco was instrumental in the development of electronic dance music genres like house, techno, and eurodance. The Eurodisco song I Feel Love, produced by Giorgio Moroder for Donna Summer in 1976, has been described as a milestone and blueprint for electronic dance music because it was the first to combine repetitive synthesizer loops with a continuous four-on-the-floor bass drum and an off-beat hi-hat, which would become a main feature of techno and house ten years later.[75][76][118]

During the first years of the 1980s, the traditional disco sound characterized by complex arrangements performed by large ensembles of studio session musicians (including a horn section and an orchestral string section) began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward electronic and pop genres, starting with hi-NRG. Despite its decline in popularity, so-called club music and European-style disco remained relatively successful in the early-to-mid 1980s with songs like Aneka's ""Japanese Boy"", The Weather Girls's ""It's Raining Men"", Stacey Q's ""Two of Hearts"", Dead or Alive's ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"", Laura Branigan's ""Self Control"", and Baltimora's ""Tarzan Boy"". However, a revival of the traditional-style disco called nu-disco has been popular since the 1990s.

House music displayed a strong disco influence, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping electronic dance music and contemporary club culture, is often described being ""disco's revenge.""[119] Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive four-on-the-floor beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines,[120] off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist,[120] and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound.

The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and DJ mixers to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting DJ mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. It, in turn, affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching and scratching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.

In the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at Paradise Garage, Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and Francis Grasso became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a cult following among clubgoers, who referred to his DJ sets as ""Saturday Mass"". Some DJs would use reel-to-reel tape recorders to make remixes and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat-matched records, the first to use electronic effects units in his mixes, and he was an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of WKTU and WBLS. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ ""profession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef.""[121] Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use their own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining their personal sound and aesthetic, and building their own reputation.[122]

The post-disco sound and genres associated with it originated in the 1970s and early 1980s with R&B and post-punk musicians focusing on a more electronic and experimental side of disco, spawning boogie, Italo disco, and alternative dance. Drawing from a diverse range of non-disco influences and techniques, such as the ""one-man band"" style of Kashif and Stevie Wonder and alternative approaches of Parliament-Funkadelic, it was driven by synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines. Post-disco acts include D. Train, Patrice Rushen, ESG, Bill Laswell, Arthur Russell. Post-disco had an important influence on dance-pop and was bridging classical disco and later forms of electronic dance music.[123]

The disco sound had a strong influence on early hip hop. Most of the early hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. The Sugarhill Gang used Chic's ""Good Times"" as the foundation for their 1979 song ""Rapper's Delight"", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.

With synthesizers and Krautrock influences that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when Afrika Bambaataa released the single ""Planet Rock"", spawning a hip hop electronic dance trend that includes songs such as Planet Patrol's ""Play at Your Own Risk"" (1982), C-Bank's ""One More Shot"" (1982), Cerrone's ""Club Underworld"" (1984), Shannon's ""Let the Music Play"" (1983), Freeez's ""I.O.U."" (1983), Midnight Star's ""Freak-a-Zoid"" (1983), and Chaka Khan's ""I Feel For You"" (1984).

House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s (also see: Chicago house). It quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, where it developed into the harder and more industrial techno, New York City (also see: garage house), and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America and Australia.[124] Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as ""Pump Up The Volume"" by MARRS (1987), ""House Nation"" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), ""Theme from S'Express"" by S'Express (1988) and ""Doctorin' the House"" by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.

House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more aggressive acid house or the minimalist microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres,[120] such as euro house, tech house, electro house, and jump house.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, rave culture began to emerge from the house and acid house scene.[125] Like house, it incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music played by DJs over powerful sound systems, recreational drug and club drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for mass consumption. In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed (mostly) underground. In part, this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid law enforcement attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like ecstasy.



The post-punk movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported punk rock's rule-breaking while rejecting its move back to raw rock music.[126] Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.[126]Public Image Limited is considered the first post-punk group.[126] The group's second album Metal Box fully embraced the ""studio as instrument"" methodology of disco.[126] The group's founder John Lydon, the former lead singer for the Sex Pistols, told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.

No wave was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City.[126] For shock value, James Chance, a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the East Village Eye urging his readers to move uptown and get ""trancin' with some superradioactive disco voodoo funk"". His band James White and the Blacks wrote a disco album titled Off White.[126] Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on).[126] In 1981 ZE Records led the transition from no wave into the more subtle mutant disco (post-disco/punk) genre.[126] Mutant disco acts such as Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Was Not Was, ESG and Liquid Liquid influenced several British post-punk acts such as New Order, Orange Juice and A Certain Ratio.[126]

Nu-disco is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco,[127] mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco aesthetics.[128] The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport.[129] These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro, and other genres popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also used to describe the music on several American labels who were previously associated with the genres electroclash and French house.

In the 1990s, after a decade of backlash, disco and its legacy became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs, films, and compilations were released that referenced disco. This was part of a wave of 1970s nostalgia that was taking place in popular culture at the time. Some commentators attributed the revival of the genre to frequent use of disco music in fashion shows.[130]

Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included Deee-Lite's ""Groove Is in the Heart"" (1990), U2's ""Lemon"" (1993), Blur's ""Girls & Boys"" (1994) and ""Entertain Me"" (1995), Pulp's ""Disco 2000"" (1995), and Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat"" (1999), while films such as Boogie Nights (1997) and The Last Days of Disco (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.

In the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called ""nu-disco"" began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like Daft Punk's ""One More Time"" and Kylie Minogue's ""Love at First Sight"" and ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with funky house, such as Spiller's ""Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"" and Modjo's ""Lady (Hear Me Tonight)"", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2000. Robbie Williams's disco single ""Rock DJ"" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Jamiroquai's song ""Little L"" and ""Murder on the Dancefloor"" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor were hits in 2001. Rock band Manic Street Preachers released a disco song, ""Miss Europa Disco Dancer"", in the same year. The song's disco influence, which appears on Know Your Enemy, was described as being ""much-discussed"".[131] In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s and released her album Confessions on a Dance Floor to rave reviews. One of the singles from the album, ""Hung Up"", which samples ABBA's 1979 song ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"", became a major club staple. In addition to Madonna's disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her Confessions Tour incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the roller derby. In 2006, Jessica Simpson released her album A Public Affair inspired by disco and the 1980s music. The first single of the album, ""A Public Affair"", was reviewed as a disco-dancing competition influenced by Madonna's early works. The video of the song was filmed on a skating rink and features a line dance of hands.[132][133][134]

The success of the ""nu-disco"" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: ""The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It's a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. Madison Avenue look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. 'Groovejet' accepts the night's changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused smile and a few great one-liners.""[135]

In 2011, K-pop girl group T-ara released Roly-Poly as a part of their EP John Travolta Wannabe. The song accumulated over 4,000,000 units in digital downloads, which became the highest number of downloads for a K-pop girl group single on the Gaon Digital Chart in the 2010s. In 2013, with several 1970s-style disco and funk being released, the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s.[136] The biggest disco song of the year was ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk, featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar. Its parent album, Random Access Memories, ended up winning Album of the Year at the 2014 Grammys.[136][137] Other disco-styled songs that made it into the top 40 that year were Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" (number one), Justin Timberlake's ""Take Back the Night"" (number 29), Bruno Mars' ""Treasure"" (number five)[136][137]Arcade Fire's Reflektor featured strong disco elements. In 2014, disco music could be found in Lady Gaga's Artpop[138][139] and Katy Perry's ""Birthday"".[140] Other disco songs from 2014 include ""I Want It All"" By Karmin, 'Wrong Club"" by the Ting Tings, ""Blow"" by Beyoncé and the William Orbit mix of ""Let Me in Your Heart Again"" by Queen.

In 2014 Brazilian Globo TV, the second biggest television network in the world, aired Boogie Oogie, a telenovela about the Disco Era that takes place between 1978 and 1979, from the hit fever to the decadence. The show's success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to the stage and to Brazilian record charts local disco divas like Lady Zu and As Frenéticas.[citation needed]

Top-10 entries from 2015 such as Mark Ronson's disco groove-infused ""Uptown Funk"", Maroon 5's ""Sugar"", the Weeknd's ""Can't Feel My Face"" and Jason Derulo's ""Want To Want Me"" also have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared in 2015 with his new album Déjà Vu, which proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like ""I Don't Like It, I Love It"" by Flo Rida, ""Adventure of a Lifetime"" by Coldplay, ""Back Together"" by Robin Thicke and ""Levels"" by Nick Jonas feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs continued showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that had been dominating the charts up until then.[citation needed] Justin Timberlake's 2016 song ""Can't Stop the Feeling!"", which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the history of the chart. The Martian, a 2015 film, extensively uses disco music as a soundtrack, although for the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, there's only one thing worse than being stranded on Mars: it's being stranded on Mars with nothing but disco music.[141] ""Kill the Lights"", featured on an episode of the HBO television series ""Vinyl"" (2016) and with Nile Rodgers' guitar licks, hit number one on the US Dance chart in July 2016.

In 2020, disco continued its mainstream popularity and became a prominent trend in popular music.[143][144] In early 2020, disco-influenced hits such as Doja Cat's ""Say So"", Lady Gaga's ""Stupid Love"", and Dua Lipa's ""Don't Start Now"" experienced widespread success on global music charts, charting at numbers 1, 5 and 2, respectively, on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. At the time, Billboard, declared that Lipa was ""leading the charge toward disco-influenced production"" a day after her retro and disco-influenced album Future Nostalgia was released on March 27, 2020.[142][145] By the end of 2020, multiple disco albums had been released, including Adam Lambert's Velvet, Jessie Ware's What's Your Pleasure?, and Róisín Murphy's discothèque mixtape, Róisín Machine. In early September 2020, South Korean group BTS debuted at number 1 in the US with their English–language disco single ""Dynamite"" having sold 265,000 downloads in its first week in the US, marking the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"" (2017).[146]

In July 2020, Australian singer Kylie Minogue announced she would be releasing her fifteenth studio album, Disco, on November 6, 2020. The album was preceded by two singles. The lead single, ""Say Something"", was released on July 23 and premiered on BBC Radio 2;[147] the second single, ""Magic"", was released on September 24.[148] Both singles received critical acclaim, with critics praising Minogue for returning to disco roots, which were prominent in her albums Light Years (2000), Fever (2001), and Aphrodite (2010)."
"Hi-NRG","

Hi-NRG (pronounced ""high energy"")[2] is a genre of uptempo disco or electronic dance music (EDM) that originated in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

As a music genre, typified by fast tempo, staccato hi-hat rhythms (and the four-on-the-floor pattern), reverberated ""intense"" vocals and ""pulsating"" octave basslines, it was particularly influential on the disco scene.

Whether hi-NRG is more rock-oriented[3] than standard disco music is a matter of opinion. Hi-NRG can be heavily synthesized but it is not a prerequisite, and whether it is devoid of ""funkiness"" is, again, in the ear of the beholder.  Certainly, many artists perform their vocals in R&B and soul styles on hi-NRG tracks.
[3] The genre's tempo ranges between 120 and 140 beats per minute.[4] The tempos cited here do not represent the full range of beats (BPM) of hi-NRG tracks; rather the tempos are retrieved from one source which is not an expert musical reference, but a sociological study of dance culture. Lyrics tend to be overtly camp, kitschy, tongue-in-cheek, sexually suggestive with double entendres[5] but also occasionally sentimental or maudlin.[6]

The sound of high energy dance tracks, particularly electronic dance or disco, is immediately identifiable by its iconic basslines, pioneered by producer Giorgio Moroder, often programmed in repeating bass sequences, particularly 16th notes, which is characteristic of the hi-NRG electronic dance sound as in ""I Feel Love"" performed by Donna Summer and produced by Moroder.[7]
The rhythm is characterized by an energetic, staccato, sequenced synthesizer sound of octave basslines or/and where the bass often takes the place of the hi-hat, alternating a more resonant note with a dampened note to signify the tempo of the record.[8][9] There is also often heavy use of the clap sound found on drum machines.

One form of hi-NRG, as performed by Megatone Records artists and Ian Levine, is any uptempo disco and dance music, whether containing octave basslines or not, that often features covers of ""classic"" Motown hits (Boys Town Gang) and torch songs, and is often ""theatrical"" in performance, featuring female (and male) musicians with facetious diva[10] personas and male musicians sometimes in ""drag"" (Sylvester, Divine), cabarets/musical theater (Vicki Sue Robinson, Sharon Redd). This style, that Stock Aitken Waterman were influenced by,[11] had a large cult following among gay club-goers in the 1980s, especially San Franciscan black and white gay men.[10]

A second form, a precursor of Italian/Japanese ""Eurobeat"", with influences of techno[12] and early Chicago house, primarily focuses on its characteristic sequenced ""octave-jumping basslines"" above anything else and in this form hi-NRG managed to surge into the mainstream with Stacey Q, Kim Wilde, and Laura Branigan. The octave basslines are also found in electroclash and in both cases may be traced to synth-pop[13] and even further back to Giorgio Moroder (""I Feel Love"").[14]

Donna Summer was interviewed about her single ""I Feel Love"", which was a mostly electronic, relatively high-tempo Euro disco song without a strong funk component. In the interview, she said ""this song became a hit because it has a high-energy vibe"".[15] Following that interview, the description ""high-energy"" was increasingly applied to high-tempo disco music, especially songs dominated by electronic timbres.[15] The tempo threshold for high-energy disco was around 130 to 140 BPM. In the 1980s, the term ""high-energy"" was stylized as ""hi-NRG"". Eurobeat, dance-pop and freestyle artists such as Shannon, Stock Aitken & Waterman, Taylor Dayne, Freeez and Michael Sembello were also labeled as ""hi-NRG"" when sold in the United States.

In the 1980s, ""hi-NRG"" referred not just to any high-tempo disco/dance music, but to a specific genre, only somewhat disco-like.

Ian Levine, a hi-NRG DJ, the in-house DJ at London's Heaven nightclub in its early years and subsequently a record producer, defines hi-NRG as ""melodic, straightforward dance music that's not too funky.""[16] Music journalist Simon Reynolds adds ""The nonfunkiness was crucial. Slamming rather than swinging, hi-NRG's white European feel was accentuated by butt-bumping bass twangs at the end of each bar.""[16]

High-tempo disco music dates back to the mid-1970s. The first hi-NRG song was Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" from 1977.[17] Other early examples include several British disco songs by Biddu and Patrick Hernandez (""Born to Be Alive"") in 1979.

In the early 1980s, high energy music found moderate mainstream popularity in Europe; while opposing both Euro disco and electro on the dance scene, it became mainstream in the gay community in the United States. Hi-NRG was reliant on technology and was all about ""unfeasibly athletic dancing, bionic sex, and superhuman stamina"".[18] The freedom associated with it seemed to be embodied by a literal escape from human embodiment, and synchrony with technology. However, this was generally limited to the bodies of men as evidenced by songs titled ""Menergy"", and ""So Many Men, So Little Time"". Producers such as Bobby Orlando and Patrick Cowley created ""an aural fantasy of a futuristic club populated entirely by Tom of Finland studs.""[18]

During the same period, a genre of music styled as ""hi-NRG"" (EDM) became popular in Canada and the UK. The most popular groups of this style are Trans-X and Lime. The genre is also closely related to space disco; bands of this genre include Koto, Laserdance, and Cerrone. The hi-NRG sound also influenced techno and house music.[citation needed]

In 1983 in the UK, music magazine Record Mirror began publishing a weekly hi-NRG chart. The style entered the British mainstream, with hits on the UK pop and dance charts (followed by the US dance charts), such as Hazell Dean's ""Searchin' (I Gotta Find a Man)"" and Evelyn Thomas's ""High Energy"".[19][20]

In the mid-1980s, hi-NRG producers in the dance and pop charts included Ian Levine and Stock Aitken Waterman, both of whom worked with many different artists. Stock Aitken Waterman had two of the most successful hi-NRG singles ever with their productions of Dead or Alive's ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"" (UK #1, CAN #1, US #11 in 1985) and Bananarama's ""Venus"" (US #1, CAN #1, UK #8 in 1986).[21]  They also brought the genre full-circle, in a sense, by writing and producing Donna Summer's 1989 hit ""This Time I Know It's for Real"" (UK #3, CAN #7, US #7).

American music magazine Dance Music Report published hi-NRG charts (and related industry news) in the mid- to late 1980s, as the genre reached its peak.[22]  By 1990, however, techno and rave music had superseded hi-NRG in popularity in many dance clubs. Despite this, hi-NRG music is still being produced and played in various forms, including many remixed versions of mainstream pop hits, some with re-recorded vocals. Later in the 1990s, nu-NRG music, a form of trance music evolved from hi-NRG, was born.[23]"
"Eurodance","

Eurodance (sometimes referred to as Euro-NRG, Euro-electronica or Euro) is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the late 1980s in Europe. It combines many elements of rap, techno and Eurodisco.[2] This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich vocals, sometimes with rapped verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizers, strong bass rhythm and melodic hooks, establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music.[2]

Eurodance music originated in the late 1980s in central Europe, especially in Germany, where rave parties were becoming popular. By 1987, a German party scene was started, based on the well established Chicago house sound and Belgian new beat. The following year saw acid house making a significant impact on popular consciousness in Germany and central Europe as it had in England.[6] In 1989, German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the Ufo Club, an illegal party venue, and co-founded the Love Parade.[7] The parade first occurred in July 1989, when 150 people took to the streets in Berlin.[8] It was conceived as a political demonstration for peace and international understanding through love and music.[8] On 19 July 1989, Black Box's single ""Ride on Time"" was released. The song spent six weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and it was the UK's best-selling single of 1989.[9] It contained the Korg M1's ""house piano""[10] which can be found in many Eurodance releases. On 27 September 1989, Technotronic's single ""Pump Up the Jam"" was released. It reached number one in Belgium[11][12] and Spain,[13] and it popularised the house variant called hip house in Europe.[14] On 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell; free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established.[7] East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that the techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period.[15] In the same year, German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John ""Virgo"" Garrett III) formed the Snap! project in Frankfurt. Snap! songs combined imported hip hop and soul vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums, mainly house music. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance.[16]

Snap!'s first single, ""The Power"", released in 1990, reached number one in the Netherlands,[17][18] Spain, Switzerland[19] and the United Kingdom,[20] and it helped to raise awareness of the genre within Europe. In the following years, other Eurodance acts formed in Frankfurt, including Jam and Spoon, Intermission and Culture Beat. After the breakthrough single ""Rhythm is a Dancer"" by Snap! in 1992 (number 1 in 12 countries),[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] new groups started to pop up all over Europe, mainly in Belgium, Netherlands and Italy. From 1992 till the decline of popularity after 1995, the sound became more and more NRG-oriented, leading to songs raising in B.P.M. up to 150. The notable songs which defined the genre in this period, dubbed as the ""golden era"" of Eurodance, are ""It's My Life"" by Dr. Alban in 1992 (number 1 in 8 countries),[30] ""No Limit"" by Dutch group 2 Unlimited in 1993 (number 1 in 14 countries, it was Europe's biggest-selling song for 1993),[31][32][33] ""What Is Love"" by Haddaway in the same year (number 1 in 13 countries),[34][35][36][13][37] ""Mr. Vain"" by Culture Beat also in the same year (number 1 in 13 countries),[38][39][37] ""Cotton Eye Joe"" by Rednex in 1994 (number 1 in 12 countries)[40][41][42][43] and ""Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)"" by Scatman John in the same year (number 1 in 9 countries).[44][45][46][47][48] In the same period the popularity of the genre also expanded further to East Asia, in nations such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; towards the end of the golden era also in Russia.[citation needed]

By 1995, Eurodance dominated European charts with 5 singles in the top 10 of the singles charts. Despite its success, many observers within the music industry said that the Eurodance sound had to change or die, and Eurodance producers and singers started to follow different paths and different sounds, such as happy hardcore and house music,[49] but not all the groups followed this trend immediately. Notably, the group 2 Unlimited wanted to remain within Eurodance sounds in order to remain chartbusters, although the producer De Coster predicted a retreat from a pop-like to a more club-like sound.[50] Nevertheless, in the second half of the decade the popularity of Eurodance started to decline, and ""Scatman's World"" by Scatman John was the last major hit of the original Eurodance sound in the Eurochart Hot 100, being number 1 for 3 weeks between late August and early September 1995.[citation needed]

In late 1990s the classic Eurodance sound gradually morphed into progressive house.[5] Notable examples of successful Eurodance songs of this era are ""Coco Jamboo"" by German band Mr. President in 1996,[51][52] ""Freed from Desire"" and ""Let a Boy Cry"" by Italian singer Gala, ""This is Your Night"" by Amber and ""Bailando"" by Paradisio in the same year,[53][54][55] ""Barbie Girl"" by Danish-Norwegian group Aqua in 1997,[56][57] ""Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!"" by Dutch group Vengaboys in 1998,[58][59][60] ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" by Italian group Eiffel 65 in 1999[61][62] and ""Around the World (La La La La La)"" by German group ATC in 2000.[63][64][65]Basshunter, Scooter and Cascada saw significant success during the 2000s,[66][67][68] however, by the early 2010s, popularity waned, and by about 2012, Eurodance music disappeared almost completely from the majority of European radio airplay.[citation needed]

The term ""Eurodance"" gradually became associated with a specific style of European dance music. During its golden years in the mid-1990s, it was referred as ""Euro-NRG""; in Europe it was often called ""dancefloor"".[69]

While some use a much broader definition of what is considered ""Eurodance"",[1] over time, the term particularly came to refer to an NRG-based genre from the 1990s which included a solo vocalist or a rapper/vocalist duet.[70]

Most Eurodance is characterized by synthesizer riffs, one or more vocals with simple chorus, one or more rap parts, sampling and a drum machine clap beat.[2][71] Sometimes non-rap vocals are used.[71]Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, and Silver Convention were early examples of pre Eurodance musicians. Swedish pop group ABBA gained disco hits such as ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"", ""Summer Night City"", and ""Voulez-Vous"".[72]

Eurodance often carries a positive, upbeat attitude; the lyrics usually involve issues of love and peace, dancing and partying, or expressing and overcoming difficult emotions. The early to mid-1990s Eurodance vocals were frequently done by a solo vocalist or a mixed rapper-vocalist duet such as the male–female duets of 2 Unlimited, La Bouche and Magic Affair.[71][73]

Many groups used variations of the rapper-vocalist theme, such as a German rapper with American singers (Real McCoy), or the use of reggae rap as in Ice MC and Fun Factory, or combination of rapper and reggae vocalist like in the Life in the Streets album, or scat singing as in Scatman John.[71] Solo singing artists such as Alexia, Whigfield and DJ BoBo also contributed to the genre. Some acts like the Swedish dance-pop originated group Ace of Base use more pop vocals rather than rap/soul vocals along with Eurodance sound.[74][75] Pop vocals were particularly popular in the late 1990s Eurodance productions. The Swedish group Rednex also introduced American country music elements into the sound.[76]

Eurodance lyrics are almost always sung in English, regardless of the artist's nationalities.[71] However, there are cases like in the Belgian group's Paradisio where Spanish lyrics are used along with latin music elements.[77][78]

Almost all Eurodance emphasizes percussion and rhythm. The tempo is typically around 140 beats per minute, but may vary from 110 to 150.[71][79]

Most Eurodance is very melody-driven. Most Eurodance songs are in minor keys, similarly to techno. This, along with positive lyrics, helps contribute to the overall powerful and emotional sound of Eurodance.[2] Besides the contribution of the female or male vocals, there is often a noticeable use of rapid synthesizer arpeggios.[2]

Eurodance music videos were often seen with dance acts by the main vocals of the songs (or models ad-libbing), often dancing in bright-coloured infinity cove studios or wide, urban spaces (stations, parking garages) with high visual contrast, or in empty nature scenes.

Electronicbeats describes the cliché Eurodance music video as having ""strobe-lit rave scenes, pixelated ‘90s computer graphics and, of course, an urban montage: cue the subway stations, streetlights and business commuters"". Pump up the Jam's music video is described as having a ""colour scheme of brilliant reds, greens and purples in a staggering array of chequered backdrops [...] [It is] a great insight tot the power of music videos on party wardrobes"".[80] Bright, sometimes over-saturated colour schemes were used, with contemporary party clothing or outfits referring to space-age, such as in Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out of My Head, with videos that were fully or in part using Computer-generated imagery elements and effects.
Large, sometimes digitally multiplied, dance troupes also frequently feature, such as in Destination Calabria.

As the music is largely electronically generated, shots of artists in studios or playing at concerts, frequent in videos of other genres, were infrequent.

From the early to mid-1990s, Eurodance was popular in Europe; the style received extensive airplay on radio stations and television shows, resulting in many singles appearing in the charts. For example, in Italy there were seven singles in the top ten of the chart at the end of May 1995. Technotronic from Belgium had hits with ""Pump Up the Jam"" and ""Get Up"" (featuring Ya Kid K).[81]

By 1996, the popularity of this genre had started to decline. From then, the classic Eurodance sound gradually morphed into progressive house.[5] By 1997 and towards the end of the millennium house and trance music increased popularity over Eurodance in Europe's commercial, chart-oriented dance records.[82][83][84] In the early 2000s, the mainstream music industry in Europe moved away from Eurodance in favour of other styles of dance music such as nu-disco, electro house, dance-pop and R&B.[85][86]

After Cappella's Gianfranco Bortolotti set up Media Records in Brescia, northern Italy[87][88][89] to release his 'commercial European dance music' (a set-up which included fifteen studios featuring various production teams working almost non-stop on a huge number of records) he decided to take the label into other markets and set up a UK office in the UK. Run by Peter Pritchard and featuring many records by Stu Allan's British Eurodance act Clock,[90] this record company would eventually turn into hard house label Nukleuz (known for its DJ Nation releases).[91][92]

As Media turned into Nukleuz, it would fall to All Around the World Productions to be the label in the 21st Century which was more likely to release Eurodance tracks in the UK than other, with its Clubland TV music channel still having regular blocks of Eurodance videos in 2020[93][94] (though extending its scope to include hits by David Guetta as well as Cascada and Scooter)

During the 1990s, Eurodance became popular in Canada, which produced its own variant called Candance (although it was mostly referred to as ""Eurodance"" or ""dance music"").[95] Eurodance received significant airplay on radio stations in the Greater Toronto Area such as Power 88.5, Energy 108 and Hot 103.5. Montreal was also a major Eurodance market, with MC Mario's famous radio show on Mix 96, called ""Party Mix"" and Bouge de là, a popular TV show on MusiquePlus. Eurodance featured prominently on Electric Circus, a dance-party TV show broadcast nationally in English and French versions.[96] Beginning in mid-1992, Eurodance began to dominate the RPM dance chart in Canada, with acts such as 2 Unlimited, Snap!, Captain Hollywood Project, Culture Beat, Haddaway, Whigfield, each reaching number-one.

From approximately 1992 to 2000, Canadian acts such as Capital Sound, Love Inc., Jacynthe and Emjay had success with the Eurodance sound. The Toronto sound was more pop-oriented, while the Montreal one was more house-oriented.

While Eurodance is well known in major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami, Eurodance did not make as big of an impact in the rest of the country. Exemplifying this is the Eurodance classic ""Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)"", by Scatman John, an American artist; despite topping the charts in multiple European countries and reaching number 3 in the United Kingdom, it only reached as high as ""number 60"" on the US Hot 100.[97] Another notable example is the Life in the Streets album, a combined Eurodance music project from American rapper Marky Mark and Caribbean reggae vocalist Prince Ital Joe, which was not released in the United States, but was a huge success in several European countries including singles like ""Happy People"" and ""United"" that topped the German charts.[98][99]

A few Eurodance artists including 2 Unlimited, Haddaway, La Bouche and Ace of Base made the Rhythmic Top 40, Top 40 Mainstream and the Billboard Hot 100 during the early to mid-1990s. However, the sound tended to be more house and the rap-oriented artists received airplay. For instance, the German hip-house project Snap!, the Belgian hip-house project Technotronic and the Dutch techno dance project L.A. Style received quite a bit of airplay early on.[100]

The more Hi-NRG-oriented artists were typically played only during special ""mix"" shows, and it was often necessary to go to a club to hear Eurodance music. While Eurodance did become popular with club DJs in the United States, radio stations were cautious about playing anything that sounded too much like disco during most of the 1980s and 1990s. By the end of the 1990s, however, some of the later acts such as Italian group Eiffel 65 and Danish group Aqua did receive extensive airplay.

Despite lack of widespread radio play, many Hi-NRG and Eurodance songs are popular at professional sporting events in the United States, especially ice hockey and basketball.[101][102]

Compilation albums, such as the DMA Dance: Eurodance series of compilation albums (1995–1997) from Interhit Records and Dance Music Authority magazine, were popular and helped to define the genre as well as to make it accessible in the U.S. and Canada.[103]

Hands Up (also known as handz up! (stylized as HandzUp!) or dancecore in Eastern Europe) is a style of trance music, and a derivation of Eurodance. The genre comes from its name, meaning music that requires listeners to ""put their hands up"", as well as fitness and danceability.

The genre developed in Germany in the mid- to late 1990s as part of the emerging trance music scene. Representatives of Eurodance such as Starsplash and Mark 'Oh are sometimes regarded as forerunners of Hands Up. The biggest commercial success was the music until the mid-2000s.[clarification needed]

The synthesizer melodies are often catchy and simple. Often the vocal melody is accompanied by a synthesizer. In contrast to techno, short, high-pitched synthesizer tones are used. Hands Up does not rely on the structure of tension build-up, but rather is based on the typical verse-chorus pop music scheme. The main elements are the bassline, drums and a catchy lead sound. A typical stylistic device of Hands Up is pitched female or resulting feminine vocals, but male vocals are also common. In addition, distorted, autotuned, chopped and repeated spoken phrases are common characteristics."
"Italo dance","Italo dance (also written Italodance) is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the mid-1990s in Italy as a regional development of eurodance; its sound subsequently evolved into a distinct, yet closely related form.

The genre had its peak of popularity from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, chiefly in Italy and San Marino, but it also enjoyed great success in the rest of Europe and in the Americas.

Most successful acts include Eiffel 65, Gabry Ponte, Paps'n'Skar, Kim Lukas, Neja, Prezioso & Marvin and Gigi D'Agostino.

The sound of the genre evolved directly from Eurodance. Italo dance displays a great influence from Italo disco, a genre which was very popular in Italy during the 1980s. Italo disco was a direct continuation of disco music (which would never experience a reject wave in Italy), incorporating the new sounds that had begun to emerge from the late 1970s. Another main influence comes from Italo house, an Italian-based form of house music also influenced by Italo disco.

The sound of Italo dance usually tends to be positive and uplifting. Lyrics are mainly about love, partying, dancing and expressing feelings, and are generally sung in English or Italian. 
The genre is characterized by the extensive use of synthesizers, piano-based melodies and simple, catchy choruses. Other typical elements are a 'metallic' bassline and the use of the four to the floor rhythmic pattern; vocals often employ vocoder and pitch correction.

Through the 1990s, several dance artists from Italy enjoyed huge international success: amongst them Alexia, Black Box, Corona, DJ Dado, Gala, Robert Miles, The Tamperer featuring Maya, Double You and Whigfield.
They became known outside Italy, in countries such as France, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. Albums like Best of Italo Dance Vol. 14 managed to make their way to the charts of some countries, as it happened in Sweden. In November 1994, WEA Italy launched the IDM (Italian Dance Machine) label, aiming to popularize Italo dance on a global scale.

In the meantime, from the mid-1990s, the sound of some artists began to evolve and become gradually distinct from ""general"" Eurodance; this new sonority broke through from the end of the decade.  During 1999, several Italo dance artists dominated the international music charts, in particular dance group Eiffel 65, but also Ann Lee, Gigi D'Agostino, Neja, Kim Lukas and Prezioso & Marvin.  Eiffel 65's first single, ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"", was released in late 1998 and became an international hit in the following year, peaking at #1 on the music charts in several countries, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. In the United States, the single reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album Europop peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200. Amongst other successful singles from the album, ""Too Much of Heaven"" and ""Move Your Body"" (both 1999).  In summer 1999, Gigi D'Agostino released his hit single ""Bla Bla Bla"", mixing Italo house and Italo dance: the song reached #3 in Austria and #4 in Germany. In 2000, he repeated the success with his signature single ""L'amour toujours"".  Also in summer 1999, Italy-based English singer Kim Lukas released her hit single ""All I Really Want"": the song entered the top 10 in Italy, Canada (peaking at #2), Denmark and Austria. Prezioso & Marvin released their single ""Tell Me Why"", also entering the top 10 in various countries.

These successes paved the way for the new genre: in 2002, Eiffel 65 DJ Gabry Ponte started a parallele solo project, releasing hit singles such as ""Geordie"" (a remake of the eponymous song by Fabrizio De André, based on a traditional English ballad) in the same year, and ""Figli di Pitagora"" in 2004, featuring Sammarinese pop-rock legend Little Tony. In 2003, Eiffel 65 participated in the Sanremo Festival with the song ""Quelli che non hanno età""; they also released successful singles in the Italo dance style, such as ""Viaggia insieme a me"" (2003). In 2005, group Paps'n'Skar released their best-known song, ""Vieni con me"".  Since the beginning of the new millennium, other artists began to release new material inspired in the Italo dance sound, even outside Italy: as an example, German group ItaloBrothers can be quoted.

After the mid-2000s, however, Italo dance's popularity began to decrease, as other genres were rising to prominence: amongst these, the electro house pioneered by Italian DJ Benny Benassi with his 2002 single ""Satisfaction"", and the music of EDM producers like Bob Sinclar and David Guetta.

Nowadays, Italo dance is still cultivated by fans, and songs in the genre are sometimes aired by radios all over the world. The genre is also usually present in retrospective music festivals, such as Arena Suzuki (Arena di Verona, Italy).

In 2022, the genre experienced a revival thanks to Dargen D'Amico's hit ""Dove si balla"", heavily inspired in Italo dance sound and atmospheres.[1][2]"
"Electronic dance music","

Electronic dance music (EDM)[1] is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres originally made for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. It is generally produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a DJ mix, by segueing from one recording to another.[2] EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. Since its inception EDM has expanded to include a wide range of subgenres.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radio, PartyCrews, underground festivals and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved mainstream popularity in Europe. However, rave culture was not as broadly popular in the United States; it was not typically seen outside of the regional scenes in New York City, Florida, the Midwest, and California. Although the pioneer genres of electro, Chicago house and Detroit techno were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the record industry in the United States remained openly hostile to it until the 1990s and beyond. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture, which led governments at state and city levels to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.[3]

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, particularly in the United States and Australia. By the early 2010s, the term ""electronic dance music"" and the initialism ""EDM"" was being pushed by the American music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture.[3] Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the acronym remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro and trance, as well as their respective subgenres, which all predate the acronym.[4][5][6]

Various EDM genres have evolved over the last 40 years, for example; house, techno, drum and bass, dance-pop etc. Stylistic variation within an established EDM genre can lead to the emergence of what is called a subgenre. Hybridization, where elements of two or more genres are combined, can lead to the emergence of an entirely new genre of EDM.[4]

In the late 1960s bands such as Silver Apples created electronic music intended for dancing.[7] Other early examples of music that influenced later electronic dance music include Jamaican dub music during the late 1960s to 1970s,[6] the synthesizer-based disco music of Italian producer Giorgio Moroder in the late 1970s, and the electropop of Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra in the mid-to-late 1970s.[5]

Author Michael Veal considers dub music, a Jamaican music stemming from roots reggae and sound system culture that flourished between 1968 and 1985, to be one of the important precursors to contemporary electronic dance music.[8] Dub productions were remixed reggae tracks that emphasized rhythm, fragmented lyrical and melodic elements, and reverberant textures.[9] The music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, King Tubby, Errol Thompson, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, and Scientist.[8] Their productions included forms of tape editing and sound processing that Veal considers comparable to techniques used in musique concrète. Dub producers made improvised deconstructions of existing multi-track reggae mixes by using the studio mixing board as a performance instrument. They also foregrounded spatial effects such as reverb and delay by using auxiliary send routings creatively.[8] The Roland Space Echo, manufactured by Roland Corporation, was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.[10]

Despite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge.[11]Ambient dub was pioneered by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists, using DJ-inspired ambient electronics, complete with drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It featured layering techniques and incorporated elements of world music, deep bass lines and harmonic sounds.[12] Techniques such as a long echo delay were also used.[13]

Hip hop music has had some influence in the development of electronic dance music since the 1970s.[14] Inspired by Jamaican sound system culture Jamaican-American DJ Kool Herc introduced large bass heavy speaker rigs to the Bronx.[15] His parties are credited with having kick-started the New York City hip-hop movement in 1973.[15] A technique developed by DJ Kool Herc that became popular in hip hop culture was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables, in alternation, and at the point where a track featured a break. This technique was further used to manually loop a purely percussive break, leading to what was later called a break beat.[16]

Turntablism has origins in the invention of the direct-drive turntable,[17] by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic).[18] In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10,[19] the first direct-drive turntable on the market,[20] and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.[19] The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200,[21] which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.[17] In the 1980s and 1990s hip-hop DJs used turntables as musical instruments in their own right and virtuosic use developed into a creative practice called turntablism.[21]

In 1974, George McCrae's early disco hit ""Rock Your Baby"" was one of the first records to use a drum machine,[22] an early Roland rhythm machine.[23] The use of drum machines in disco production was influenced by Sly and the Family Stone's ""Family Affair"" (1971), with its rhythm echoed in McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"",[24] and Timmy Thomas' ""Why Can't We Live Together"" (1972).[25][23][24] Disco producer Biddu used synthesizers in several disco songs from 1976 to 1977, including ""Bionic Boogie"" from Rain Forest (1976),[26] ""Soul Coaxing"" (1977),[27] and Eastern Man and Futuristic Journey[28][29] (recorded from 1976 to 1977).[30]

Acts like Donna Summer, Chic, Earth, Wind, and Fire, Heatwave, and the Village People helped define the late 1970s disco sound. Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte produced ""I Feel Love"" for Donna Summer in 1977. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesized backing track. Other disco producers, most famously American producer Tom Moulton, grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the four-on-the-floor style that dominated.[31][32] During the early 1980s, the popularity of disco music sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major US record labels and producers. Euro disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene.[33]

Synth-pop (short for synthesizer pop;[34] also called techno-pop[35][36]) is a music genre that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument.[37] It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late 1970s.

Early synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin Blondes[citation needed]. The Human League used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.

The use of digital sampling and looping in popular music was pioneered by Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO).[38][39][40][41] Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.[40] ""Computer Game/Firecracker"" (1978) interpolated a Martin Denny melody,[42] and sampled Space Invaders[43]video game sounds.[42]Technodelic (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and loops.[39][41] The album was produced using Toshiba-EMI's LMD-649 digital PCM sampler, which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.[41][better source needed] The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese synthpop artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as Chiemi Manabe[44] and Logic System.[45]

The emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new electronic musical instruments, particularly those from the Japanese Roland Corporation. The Roland TR-808 (often abbreviated as the ""808"") notably played an important role in the evolution of dance music,[46] after Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock"" (1982), made it very popular on dancefloors.[47] The track, which also featured the melody line from Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express, informed the development of electronic dance music,[48] and subgenres including Miami bass and Detroit techno, and popularized the 808 as a ""fundamental element of futuristic sound"".[49] According to Slate, ""Planet Rock"" ""didn't so much put the 808 on the map so much as reorient an entire world of post-disco dance music around it"".[50] The Roland TR-909, TB-303 and Juno-60 similarly influenced electronic dance music such as techno, house and acid.[51][52][53]

During the post-disco era that followed the backlash against ""disco"" which began in the mid to late 1979, which in the United States lead to civil unrest and a riot in Chicago known as the Disco Demolition Night,[13] an underground movement of ""stripped-down"" disco inspired music featuring ""radically different sounds""[14] started to emerge on the East Coast.[15] [Note 1] This new scene was seen primarily in the New York metropolitan area and was initially led by the urban contemporary artists that were responding to the over-commercialization and subsequent demise of disco culture. The sound that emerged originated from P-Funk[18] the electronic side of disco, dub music, and other genres. Much of the music produced during this time was, like disco, catering to a singles-driven market.[14] At this time creative control started shifting to independent record companies, less established producers, and club DJs.[14] Other dance styles that began to become popular during the post-disco era include dance-pop,[19] [20]boogie,[14]electro, Hi-NRG, Italo disco, house,[19] [21] [22] [23] and techno.[22] [24] [25] [26] [27]

In the early 1980s, electro (short for ""electro-funk"") emerged as a fusion of synth-pop, funk, and boogie. Also called electro-funk or electro-boogie, but later shortened to electro, cited pioneers include Ryuichi Sakamoto, Afrika Bambaataa,[54]Zapp,[55]D.Train,[56] and Sinnamon.[56] Early hip hop and rap combined with German and Japanese electropop influences such as Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra inspired the birth of electro.[57] As the electronic sound developed, instruments such as the bass guitar and drums were replaced by synthesizers and most notably by iconic drum machines, particularly the Roland TR-808 and the Yamaha DX7.[58] Early uses of the TR-808 include several Yellow Magic Orchestra tracks in 1980–1981, the 1982 track ""Planet Rock"" by Afrika Bambaataa, and the 1982 song ""Sexual Healing"" by Marvin Gaye.[59] In 1982, producer Arthur Baker, with Afrika Bambaataa, released the seminal ""Planet Rock"", which was influenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra, used Kraftwerk samples, and had drum beats supplied by the TR-808. Planet Rock was followed later that year by another breakthrough electro record, ""Nunk"" by Warp 9. In 1983, Hashim created an electro-funk sound with ""Al-Naafyish (The Soul)""[54] that influenced Herbie Hancock, resulting in his hit single ""Rockit"" the same year. The early 1980s were electro's mainstream peak. According to author Steve Taylor,[60]
Afrika Bambaataa's  Planet Rock serves as a ""template for all interesting dance music since"".[60]

In the early 1980s, Chicago radio jocks The Hot Mix 5 and club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played various styles of dance music, including older disco records (mostly Philly disco and Salsoul[61] tracks), electro funk tracks by artists such as Afrika Bambaataa,[62] newer Italo disco, B-Boy hip hop music by Man Parrish, Jellybean Benitez, Arthur Baker, and John Robie, and electronic pop music by Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Some made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, and sometimes mixed in effects, drum machines, and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation. The hypnotic electronic dance song ""On and On"", produced in 1984 by Chicago DJ Jesse Saunders and co-written by Vince Lawrence, had elements that became staples of the early house sound, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and minimal vocals as well as a Roland (specifically TR-808) drum machine and Korg (specifically Poly-61) synthesizer.

""On and On"" is sometimes cited as the 'first house record',[63][64] though other examples from around that time, such as J.M. Silk's ""Music is the Key"" (1985), have also been cited.[65] House music quickly spread to American cities including New York City, and Newark, and Detroit—all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.[66] Chicago House experienced some commercial success in Europe with releases such as ""House Nation"" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987). Following this, a number of house inspired releases such as ""Pump Up The Volume"" by M|A|R|R|S (1987), ""Theme from S'Express"" by S'Express (1988), and ""Doctorin' the House"" by Coldcut (1988) entered the pop charts.

The electronic instrumentation and minimal arrangement of Charanjit Singh's Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat (1982), an album of Indian ragas performed in a disco style, anticipated the sounds of acid house music, but it is not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.[67][68][69]

In the 1980s, Detroit DJs Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson laid the foundation for a new style of music which would dubbed techno. They fused Chicago house influenced electronic and Detroit (including Motown) influenced funk sounds with the mechanical vibes of the post-industrial city, creating the techno sound of four-on-the-floor beat driven by a kick drum on the quarter notes and a snare or high hat on the second, fourth, or eighth notes.

In the mid-1980s house music thrived on the small Balearic Island of Ibiza, Spain. The Balearic sound was the spirit of the music emerging from the island at that time; the combination of old vinyl rock, pop, reggae, and disco records paired with an ""anything goes"" attitude made Ibiza a hub of drug-induced musical experimentation.[70] A club called Amnesia, whose resident DJ, Alfredo Fiorito, pioneered Balearic house, was the center of the scene.[71] Amnesia became known across Europe and by the mid to late 1980s it was drawing people from all over the continent.[72]

By 1988, house music had become the most popular form of club music in Europe, with acid house developing as a notable trend in the United Kingdom and Germany in the same year.[73] In the UK an established warehouse party subculture, centered on the British African-Caribbean sound system scene fueled underground after-parties that featured dance music exclusively. Also in 1988, the Balearic party vibe associated with Ibiza's DJ Alfredo was transported to London, when Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both places became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that MDMA gained prominence as a party drug. Other important UK clubs included Back to Basics in Leeds, Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and The Haçienda in Manchester, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American underground dance music.[Note 1][74] The success of house and acid house paved the way for Detroit Techno, a style that was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with Detroit clubs catching up later.[75] The term Techno first came into use after a release of a 10 Records/Virgin Records compilation titled Techno: The Dance Sound of Detroit in 1988.[76]

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's ""Strings of Life"" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, ""Nude Photo"" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love).[77] It became May's best-known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, ""just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline.""[78] According to British DJ Mark Moore, ""Strings of Life"" led London club-goers to accept house: ""because most people hated house music and it was all rare groove and hip hop...I'd play 'Strings of Life' at the Mudd Club and clear the floor"".[79][Note 2] By the late 1980s interest in house, acid house and techno escalated in the club scene and MDMA-fueled club-goers, who were faced with a 2 a.m. closing time in the UK, started to seek after-hours refuge at all-night warehouse parties. Within a year, in summer 1989, up to 25,000 people at a time were attending commercially organised underground parties called raves.[1]

Trance emerged from the rave scene in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and developed further during the early 1990s in Germany before spreading throughout the rest of Europe, as a more melodic offshoot from techno and house.[citation needed] At the same time trance music was developing in Europe, the genre was also gathering a following in the Indian state of Goa.[81]
Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as ""grand, soaring, and operatic"" and ""ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths"".[82][83] Trance music is broken into a number of subgenres including acid trance, classic trance, hard trance, progressive trance,[84] and uplifting trance.[84][citation needed]Uplifting trance is also known as ""anthem trance"", ""epic trance"",[84] ""commercial trance"",  ""stadium trance"", or ""euphoric trance"",[85] and has been strongly influenced by classical music in the 1990s[84] and 2000s by leading artists such as Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren, Tiësto, Push, Rank 1 and at present with the development of the subgenre ""orchestral uplifting trance"" or ""uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra"" by such artists as Andy Blueman, Ciro Visone, Soundlift, Arctic Moon, Sergey Nevone&Simon O'Shine etc. Closely related to Uplifting Trance is Euro-trance, which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, Tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno, and Vocal trance ""combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music"".[84] The dream trance genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by Robert Miles.

AllMusic states on progressive trance: ""the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place. Emphasizing the smoother sound of Eurodance or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of Jean-Michel Jarre than Basement Jaxx), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium. Critics ridiculed its focus on predictable breakdowns and relative lack of skill to beat-mix, but progressive trance was caned by the hottest DJ.""[86]

By the early 1990s, a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from American house and techno. This music, much like hip-hop before it, combined sampled syncopated beats or breakbeats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres, and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue, and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so-called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or beats per minute (BPM). This subgenre was known as ""hardcore"" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo breakbeats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as ""jungle techno"", a genre influenced by Jack Smooth and Basement Records, and later just ""jungle"", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on pirate radio in Britain. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.

By 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as junglists) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the raggamuffin sound, dancehall, MC chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.[87]

Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub-bass frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of UK garage, drawing on a lineage of related styles such as 2-step, dub reggae, jungle, broken beat, and grime.[88][89] In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s.[89][90]

The earliest known dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as B-sides of 2-step garage single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's nightclub Plastic People, at the ""Forward"" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considered influential to the development of dubstep. The term ""dubstep"" in reference to a genre of music began to be used around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.[91]

Electro house is a form of house music characterized by a prominent bassline or kick drum and a tempo between 125 and 135 beats per minute, usually 128.[92][93][94] Its origins were influenced by electro.[citation needed] The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Hardwell, Skrillex,[95][96] and Steve Aoki.[97] Italian DJ Benny Benassi, with his track ""Satisfaction"" released in 2002, is seen as the forerunner of electro-house who brought it to the mainstream.[98] By the mid-2000s, electro-house saw an increase in popularity, with hits such as the Tom Neville remix of Studio B's ""I See Girls"" in 2005 (UK #11). In November 2006, electro-house tracks ""Put Your Hands Up for Detroit"" by Fedde Le Grand and the D. Ramirez remix of ""Yeah Yeah"" by Bodyrox and Luciana held the number one and number two spots, respectively, on the UK top 40 singles chart.[99] Since then, electro-house producers such as Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Porter Robinson, Yasutaka Nakata[100] and Dada Life have emerged.

Trap music originated from techno, dub, and Dutch house, but also from the original off-shoot of Southern hip hop in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This form of trap music can be simplified by these three features: ""1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure are similar, most tracks are usually between 70 and 110 bpm) – with vocals sometimes being pitched down, 1/3 dance music –  high-pitched Dutch synth work, hardstyle sampling, as well as a plethora of trap remixes of popular EDM songs, and 1/3 dub (low-frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)"".[101] Some of the artists that popularized this genre, along with several others, are producers such as RL Grime with the tracks ""Core"" and ""Scylla"" released in 2014, Flosstradamus with their Hdynation Radio album released in 2015 and Carnage with his track ""Turn Up"" released in 2012.[101] Trap music in this connotation was characterized by ""soulful synths, 808s, the pan flute, sharp snares and long, syrup-slurred vowels"" which created dirty and aggressive beats resulting in ""dark melodies"". Trap is now mainly used to create remixes of already existing songs.[102][101]

In 1980 English producer Richard James Burgess, and his band Landscape, used the term on the sleeve of the single ""European Man"": ""Electronic Dance Music... EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure."" In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic Burgess has stated that: ""Initially I was using three terms – Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic.""[103][104]

Writing in The Guardian, journalist Simon Reynolds noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US ""rave culture"" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. It has been described as an era of electronic music, being described in a MixMag article as being ""the drop-heavy, stadium-filling, fist-pumping, chart-topping, massively commercial main stage sound that conquered America...possibly somewhere between electro and progressive house, directed by Michael Bay, and like many music genres, trying to pin it down exactly is like trying to grab a fistful of water"".[105] In the UK, ""dance music"" or ""dance"" are more common terms for EDM.[4] What is widely perceived to be ""club music"" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, ""electronic dance music"" can mean different things to different people. Both ""club music"" and ""EDM"" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).[96] Though Billboard debuted a ""dance"" chart in 1974, the larger US music industry did not create music charts until the late 1990s.[93] In July 1995, Nervous Records and Project X Magazine hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the ""Electronic Dance Music Awards"".[Note 4]

Electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a recording studio with specialized equipment such as samplers, synthesizers, effects units and MIDI controllers all set up to interact with one another using the MIDI protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s, the use of software has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a digital audio workstation (DAW), with various plug-ins installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a MIDI keyboard. This setup is generally sufficient to complete entire productions, which are then ready for mastering.[106]

A ghost producer is a hired music producer in a business arrangement who produces a song for another DJ/artist that releases it as their own,[107] typically under a contract which prevents them from identifying themselves as a personnel of the song.[108] Ghost producers receive a simple fee or royalty payments for their work and are often able to work in their preference of not having the intense pressure of fame and the lifestyle of an internationally recognized DJ.[107] A ghost producer may increase their notability in the music industry by acquainting with established ""big name"" DJs and producers.[107] Producers like Martin Garrix and Porter Robinson are often noted for their ghost production work for other producers while David Guetta and Steve Aoki are noted for their usage of ghost producers in their songs whereas DJs like Tiësto have been openly crediting their producers in an attempt to avoid censure and for transparency.[109]

Many ghost producers sign agreements that prevent them from working for anyone else or establishing themselves as a solo artist.[110] Such non-disclosure agreements are often noted as predatory because ghost producers, especially teenage producers, do not have an understanding of the music industry.[110] London producer Mat Zo has alleged that DJs who hire ghost producers ""have pretended to make their own music and [left] us actual producers to struggle"".[111]

A bedroom producer is an independent musician who creates electronic music on their laptop or in a home studio. Unlike in traditional recording studios, bedroom producers typically use low-cost, accessible software and equipment which can lead to music being created completely ""in the box,"" with no external hardware.[112]

Initially, the popularization of electronic dance music was associated with European rave and club culture and it achieved limited popular exposure in the United States. By the mid-to-late 1990s this began to change as the American music industry made efforts to market a range of dance genres as ""electronica"".[113] At the time, a wave of electronic music bands from the United Kingdom, including The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Underworld, had been prematurely associated with an ""American electronica revolution"".[114][115] But rather than finding mainstream success, many established EDM acts were relegated to the margins of the US industry.[114] In 1998, Madonna's album Ray of Light—heavily influenced by club music trends and produced with British producer William Orbit—brought dance music to the attention of popular music listeners.[116][117] In the late 1990s, despite US media interest in dance music re-branded as electronica, American house and techno producers continued to travel abroad to establish their careers as DJs and producers.[114] According to New York Times journalist Kelefa Sanneh, Aaliyah's 2000 single ""Try Again"" ""helped smuggle the innovative techniques of electronic dance music onto the American pop charts""[118]

By the mid-2000s, Dutch producer Tiësto was bringing worldwide popular attention to EDM after providing a soundtrack to the entry of athletes during the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics — an event which The Guardian deemed as one of the 50 most important events in dance music.[119] In 2003, the influence of dance music on American radio resulted in Billboard creating the first-ever Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart.[120] By 2005, the prominence of dance music in North American popular culture had markedly increased. According to Spin, Daft Punk's performance at Coachella in 2006 was the ""tipping point"" for EDM—it introduced the duo to a new generation of ""rock kids"".[114] As noted by Entertainment Weekly, Justin Timberlake's ""SexyBack"" helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio, as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with the singer's R&B sounds.[121][122] In 2009, French house musician David Guetta began to gain prominence in mainstream pop music thanks to several crossover hits on Top 40 charts such as ""When Love Takes Over"" with Kelly Rowland,[123] as well as his collaborations with US pop and hip hop acts such as Akon (""Sexy Bitch"") and The Black Eyed Peas (""I Gotta Feeling"").[124] The music sharing website SoundCloud, as well as the video sharing website YouTube, also helped fuel interest in electronic music. Dubstep producer Skrillex popularized a harsher sound dubbed ""Brostep"", which had drawn comparisons to the aggression and tone of heavy metal.[3][125][126][127]

With the increasing popularity of electronic dance music, promoters and venues realized that DJs could generate larger profits than traditional musicians; Diplo explained that ""a band plays [for] 45 minutes; DJs can play for four hours. Rock bands—there's a few headliner dudes that can play 3,000–4,000-capacity venues, but DJs play the same venues, they turn the crowd over two times, people buy drinks all night long at higher prices—it's a win-win.""[114] Electronic music festivals, such as Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) in Las Vegas and Ultra Music Festival in Miami also grew in size, placing an increased emphasis on visual experiences, and DJs who had begun to attain a celebrity status.[3][125] Other major acts that gained prominence, including Avicii and Swedish House Mafia, toured major venues such as arenas and stadiums rather than playing clubs; in December 2011, Swedish House Mafia became the first electronic music act to sell out New York City's Madison Square Garden.[125]

In 2011, Spin declared a ""new rave generation"" led by acts like David Guetta, Deadmau5, and Skrillex.[114] In January 2013, Billboard introduced a new EDM-focused Dance/Electronic Songs chart, tracking the top 50 electronic songs based on sales, radio airplay, club play, and online streaming.[128] According to Eventbrite, EDM fans are more likely to use social media to discover and share events or gigs. They also discovered that 78% of fans say they are more likely to attend an event if their peers do, compared to 43% of fans in general. EDM has many young and social fans.[129] By late 2011, Music Trades was describing electronic dance music as the fastest-growing genre in the world.[130] Elements of electronic music also became increasingly prominent in pop music.[114] Radio and television also contributed to dance music's mainstream acceptance.[131]

Corporate consolidation in the EDM industry began in 2012—especially in terms of live events. In June 2012, media executive Robert F. X. Sillerman—founder of what is now Live Nation—re-launched SFX Entertainment as an EDM conglomerate, and announced his plan to invest $1 billion to acquire EDM businesses. His acquisitions included regional promoters and festivals (including ID&T, which organises Tomorrowland), two nightclub operators in Miami, and Beatport, an online music store which focuses on electronic music.[132][133] Live Nation also acquired Cream Holdings and Hard Events, and announced a ""creative partnership"" with EDC organizers Insomniac Events in 2013 that would allow it to access its resources whilst remaining an independent company;[134] Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino described EDM as the ""[new] rock 'n' roll"".[113][135][136]

US radio conglomerate iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Media and Entertainment) also made efforts to align itself with EDM. In January 2014 It hired noted British DJ and BBC Radio 1 personality Pete Tong to produce programming for its ""Evolution"" dance radio brand,[137] and announced a partnership with SFX to co-produce live concerts and EDM-oriented original programming for its top 40 radio stations. iHeartMedia president John Sykes explained that he wanted his company's properties to be the ""best destination [for EDM]"".[138][139]

Major brands have also used the EDM phenomena as a means of targeting millennials[140][141][142][143] and EDM songs and artists have increasingly been featured in television commercials and programs.[144] Avicii's manager Ash Pournouri compared these practices to the commercialization of hip-hop in the early 2000s.[144]Heineken has a marketing relationship with the Ultra Music Festival, and has incorporated Dutch producers Armin van Buuren and Tiësto into its ad campaigns. Anheuser-Busch has a similar relationship as beer sponsor of SFX Entertainment events.[144] In 2014, 7 Up launched ""7x7Up""—a multi-platform EDM-based campaign that included digital content, advertising featuring producers, and branded stages at both Ultra and Electric Daisy Carnival.[140][145][146] Wireless carrier T-Mobile US entered into an agreement with SFX to become the official wireless sponsor of its events, and partnered with Above & Beyond to sponsor its 2015 tour.[141]

In August 2015, SFX began to experience declines in its value,[147] and a failed bid by CEO Sillerman to take the company private. The company began looking into strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company.[148][149] In October 2015, Forbes declared the possibility of an EDM ""bubble"", in the wake of the declines at SFX Entertainment, slowing growth in revenue, the increasing costs of organizing festivals and booking talent, as well as an oversaturation of festivals in the eastern and western United States. Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella felt that the industry would weather the financial uncertainty of the overall market by focusing on ""innovation"" and entering into new markets.[150] Despite forecasts that interest in popular EDM would wane, in 2015 it was estimated to be a £5.5bn industry in the US, up by 60% compared to 2012 estimates.[151]

SFX emerged from bankruptcy in December 2016 as LiveStyle, under the leadership of Randy Phillips, a former executive of AEG Live.[152][153] The company began to slowly divest its live music assets in 2018, including selling its stakes in Rock in Rio (which it had bought as part of an attempted Las Vegas edition of the festival),[154][155] and later other SFX-owned promoters such as ID&T[156][157] and React Presents.[158] Phillips stepped down as CEO in 2019 to pursue other projects.[159]

Following the popularization of EDM in America a number of producers and DJs, including Carl Cox, Steve Lawler, and Markus Schulz, raised concerns that the perceived over-commercialisation of dance music had impacted the art of DJing. Cox saw the ""press-play"" approach taken by newer EDM DJs as unrepresentative of what he called a ""DJ ethos"".[125] Writing in Mixmag, DJ Tim Sheridan argued that ""push-button DJs"" who use auto-sync and play pre-recorded sets of ""obvious hits"" resulted in a situation overtaken by ""the spectacle, money and the showbiz"".[160]

Some house producers openly admitted that ""commercial"" EDM needed further differentiation and creativity. Avicii, whose 2013 album True featured songs incorporating elements of bluegrass, such as lead single ""Wake Me Up"", stated that most EDM lacked ""longevity"".[161] Deadmau5 criticized the homogenization of popular EDM, and suggested that it ""all sounds the same"". During the 2014 Ultra Music Festival, Deadmau5 made critical comments about up-and-coming EDM artist Martin Garrix and later played an edited version of Garrix's ""Animals"" remixed to the melody of ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"". Afterwards, Tiësto criticized Deadmau5 on Twitter for ""sarcastically"" mixing Avicii's ""Levels"" with his own ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"" (in reference to being a last-minute substitution for Avicii on the festival schedule due to a medical issue), to which Deadmau5 asked whether playing a song ""sarcastically"" involved ""sneer[ing] while hitting the sync button"".[162][163][164][165]

In May 2014, the NBC comedy series Saturday Night Live parodied the stereotypes of EDM culture and push-button DJs in a Digital Short titled When Will the Bass Drop?. It featured a DJ who goes about performing everyday activities—playing a computer game, frying eggs, collecting money—who then presses a giant ""BASS"" button, which explodes the heads of concertgoers.[166][167][168]

After years of rapid growth, the American popular EDM market started to wane in 2016 when a number of artists famous for producing so-called 'big room' electro-house started to diversify stylistically. This development was directly referenced by two such DJs – David Guetta and Showtek – in a techno-influenced single released in April 2016 titled 'The Death of EDM'.[169] By the end of the 2010s, EDM's position as the dominant force in mainstream popular music began to plateau as it became displaced by other styles.[105][170]

In May 2015, the International Music Summit's Business Report estimated that the global electronic music industry had reached nearly $6.9 billion in value; the count included music sales, events revenue (including nightclubs and festivals), the sale of DJ equipment and software, and other sources of revenue. The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including East Asia, India, and South Africa, credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests. A number of major festivals also began expanding into Latin America.[171]

In Ghana, West Africa, an artist named Djsky introduced EDM in 2015–present and organised successful festivals and events such as Hey Ibiza, Sunset music Festival, Sky show and more.[172][173][174][175] In an interview with WatsUp TV, Djsky revealed he was the first to introduce Electronic Music Dance into Ghana music.[176][177]

In Ethiopia EDM has become part of mainstream music after the 2018 breakthrough of a young artist named Rophnan which incorporated EDM sound with traditional rhythms and melodies.[178] In his shows, tens of thousands of youth were packing stadiums across the country and radios started to play the emerging genre.[179][180]

China is a market where EDM had initially made relatively few inroads; although promoters believed that the mostly instrumental music would remove a metaphorical language barrier, the growth of EDM in China was hampered by the lack of a prominent rave culture in the country as in other regions, as well as the popularity of domestic Chinese pop over foreign artists. Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of Shanghai's inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a title sponsorship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as Avicii and Wang Leehom's ""Lose Myself"". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's ""hands-on"" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in ""encouraging"" the growth of EDM in the country.[181][182]

In the 1980s, electronic dance music was often played at illegal underground rave parties held in secret locations, for example, warehouses, abandoned aircraft hangars, fields and any other large, open areas. In the 1990s and 2000s, aspects of the underground rave culture of the 1980s and early 1990s began to evolve into legitimate, organized EDM concerts and festivals. Major festivals often feature a large number of acts representing various EDM genres spread across multiple stages. Festivals have placed a larger emphasis on visual spectacles as part of their overall experiences, including elaborate stage designs with underlying thematics, complex lighting systems, laser shows, and pyrotechnics. Rave fashion also evolved among attendees, which The Guardian described as having progressed from the 1990s ""kandi raver"" to ""[a] slick and sexified yet also kitschy-surreal image midway between Venice Beach and Cirque du Soleil, Willy Wonka and a gay pride parade"".[3][125][145] These events differed from underground raves by their organized nature, often taking place at major venues, and with measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.[184]MTV's Rawley Bornstein described electronic music as ""the new rock and roll"",[185] as has Lollapalooza organizer Perry Farrell.[186]

Ray Waddell of Billboard noted that festival promoters have done an excellent job at branding.[185] Larger festivals have been shown to have positive economic impacts on their host cities[184] the 2014 Ultra Music Festival brought 165,000 attendees—and over $223 million—to the Miami/South Florida region's economy.[146] The inaugural edition of TomorrowWorld—a U.S.-based version of Belgium's Tomorrowland festival, brought $85.1 million to the Atlanta area—as much revenue as its hosting of the NCAA Final Four (the semi-final and national championship games of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament) earlier in the year.[187] EDC Las Vegas boosted the Clark County economy by $350.3 million in 2015 alone, with over 405,000 attendees across three days (June 19–21).[188]

The popularity of EDM and festivals also led some multi-genre festivals not strongly associated with electronic music, such as Coachella and Lollapalooza, to add more electronic acts to their lineup. They often play EDM-specific stages, but major acts such as Deadmau5, Calvin Harris and Subtronics have made overall headlining appearances on the main stages of Lollapalooza and Coachella respectively—placements that are typically associated with rock and alternative acts.[189][190]Russell Smith of The Globe and Mail felt that the commercial festival industry was an antithesis to the original principles of the rave subculture, citing ""the expensive tickets, the giant corporate sponsors, the crass bro culture—shirtless muscle boys who cruise the stadiums, tiny popular girls in bikinis who ride on their shoulders – not to mention the sappy music itself.""[191] Drug-related incidents, as well as other complaints surrounding the behaviour of their attendees, have contributed to negative perceptions and opposition to electronic music events by local authorities.[191][192]

After Ultra Music Festival 2014, where a crowd of gatecrashers trampled a security guard on its first day, Miami's city commissioners considered banning the festival from being held in the city, citing the trampling incident, lewd behavior, and complaints by downtown residents of being harassed by attendees. The commissioners voted to allow Ultra to continue being held in Miami due to its positive economic effects, under the condition that its organizers address security, drug usage and lewd behavior by attendees.[193][194][195] In 2018, after continued concerns, the commissioners voted to bar the festival from being held in Bayfront Park and downtown Miami,[196][197][198] but subsequently approved a proposal to move the event to one of Miami's barrier islands, Virginia Key.[199] Following the festival, which was impacted by transportation issues (as there is only one vehicular link between Virginia Key and mainland Miami) and other problems, Ultra pulled out of the agreement, and negotiated an agreement to return to Bayfront Park.[200][201] The UK Jungle and Drum and Bass focused record label, Hospital Records, runs a festival called Hospitality[202] in clubs and other locations scattered around the UK and other countries with big EDM influence. These events are usually concerts from artists on the record's roster of musicians.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellation of festivals, accompanied by the restrictions on social distancing has negatively impacted economic activity of festivals and the music industry.[203] Festivals are required to have regulations on health and safety, as well as deal with crisis and risk management, since they are at high risk due to the mass of people that attend. As a result, it has become normal for festivals or performances to be streamed online.[203]

During 2020, all large EDM music festivals were postponed or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 4, 2020, Ultra Miami was the first electronic dance music festival to cancel an event since the event could not conform to the state's capacity rules and county's safety protocols and regulations.[204] On April 21, 2020, Electric Forest music festival in Rothbury, Michigan rescheduled their event on June 25–27, 2020 to June 2021 due to health concerns.[205] On July 9, 2020, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio decided that all sizeable events will be suspended through September 30.[206] As a result, Electric Zoo 2020, which takes place on Randall's Island in New York City during Labor Day Weekend, fully canceled their 2020 event.

Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas (EDC), the biggest dance music festival in North America, was scheduled to happen on May 15–17, 2020. In April, EDC postponed their May event to October 2–4, 2020, and later declared on August 2 that EDC Las Vegas 2020 would be officially canceled.[207] Instead, EDC CEO Pasquale Rotella announced the celebration of EDC's 25th anniversary on May 21–23, 2021.[208] On April 9, 2021, EDC had not yet released their lineup and COVID-19 safety protocols for the event happening in May 2021.[209] On April 20, 2021, Rotella postponed the festival to October 22–24, 2021.[210]

The cancellations of these events economically hurt the music industry and the companies that run these events. EDC 2020 originally sold out of the 200,000 tickets for their first event, but offered full returns for those who could not make it to new dates.[211] Electric Zoo included an incentive for customers to keep their ticket by providing an extra $50 for General Admission tickets and $100 for VIP tickets to spend on merchandise and food on festival grounds.[206]  Most music festival companies offered to rollover the ticket to their next event or give full refunds to those who could not attend, but ultimately lost a lot of customers due to the uncertainty of COVID-19.[203]

Dance music has a long association with recreational drug use,[212] particularly with a wide range of drugs that have been categorized under the name ""club drugs"". Russell Smith noted that the association of drugs and music subcultures was by no means exclusive to electronic music, citing previous examples of music genres that were associated with certain drugs, such as psychedelic rock and LSD, disco music and cocaine, and punk music and heroin.[191]

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ecstasy, ""E"", or ""Molly"", is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and house parties.[213] In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the ""rave"" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.[214] Another drug para-Methoxyamphetamine (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, ""Death"" or ""Dr. Death"", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure. People who take PMA are often mistaken for it being identified as MDMA.[215][216]

MDMA is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs. The more common combinations include MDMA combined with LSD, MDMA combined with DMT, MDMA with psilocybin mushrooms, and MDMA with the dissociative drug ketamine. Many users use mentholated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drug's effects. Examples include menthol cigarettes, Vicks VapoRub, NyQuil,[217] and lozenges.

The incidence of nonmedical ketamine has increased in the context of raves and other parties.[218] However, its emergence as a club drug differs from other club drugs (e.g. MDMA) due to its anesthetic properties (e.g., slurred speech, immobilization) at higher doses;[219] in addition, there are reports of ketamine being sold as ""ecstasy"".[220] The use of ketamine as part of a ""postclubbing experience"" has also been documented.[221] Ketamine's rise in the dance culture was rapid in Hong Kong by the end of the 1990s.[219] Before becoming a federally controlled substance in the United States in 1999, ketamine was available as diverted pharmaceutical preparations and as a pure powder sold in bulk quantities from domestic chemical supply companies.[222] Much of the current ketamine diverted for nonmedical use originates in China and India.[222]

A number of deaths attributed to apparent drug use have occurred at major electronic music concerts and festivals. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum blacklisted Insomniac Events after an underaged attendee died from ""complications of ischemic encephalopathy due to methylenedioxymethamphetamine intoxication"" during Electric Daisy Carnival 2010; as a result, the event was re-located to Las Vegas the following year.[223][184][224][225][226] Drug-related deaths during Electric Zoo 2013 in New York City, United States, and Future Music Festival Asia 2014 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, prompted the final day of both events to be cancelled,[225][227] while Life in Color cancelled a planned event in Malaysia out of concern for the incident, and other drug-related deaths that occurred at the A State of Trance 650 concerts in Jakarta, Indonesia.[228][229][230]

In September 2016, the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina banned all electronic music events, pending future legislation, after five drug-related deaths and four injuries at a Time Warp Festival event in the city in April 2016. The ban forced electronic band Kraftwerk to cancel a planned concert in the city, despite arguing that there were dissimilarities between a festival and their concerts.[231][232]

(alphabetical)"
"Dance-pop","Dance-pop is a subgenre of pop music that originated in the late 1970s to early 1980s. It is generally uptempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of dance and pop with influences of disco,[2] post-disco[3] and synth-pop,[1] it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures[2] which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.[2] The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.[2]
Dance-pop is highly eclectic, having borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producers, artists and periods. Such include contemporary R&B, house, trance, techno, electropop, new jack swing, funk and pop rock.
Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable artists include Cher, Madonna, Britney Spears, Rick Astley, Kylie Minogue, Christina Aguilera, Spice Girls, Paula Abdul, Backstreet Boys, Michael Jackson, NSYNC, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, Years & Years, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Ava Max, among others.
Dance-pop generally contains several notable characteristics:
Up-tempo and upbeat music that dance-oriented or dance-centered, characterized by a fast-paced and accelerated musical tempo with a nightclub-oriented appeal.
Catchy hooks accompanied with a readily comprehensible melody and memorable rhythm, while maintaining a fast-paced and energetic tempo and conforming to a commercially viable pop-oriented song structure catered and suitable for radio airplay and appeals to a mainstream audience.
A strong emphasis on beats, grooves and rhythms that are musically arranged within a rudimentary framework.
Prominent hooks.
Simple lyrics.
Polished productions."
"Alternative dance","Alternative dance (also known as indie dance[4] or underground dance in the United States[5]) is a musical genre that mixes alternative rock with electronic dance music. Although largely confined to the British Isles, it has gained American and worldwide exposure through acts such as New Order in the 1980s and the Prodigy and in the 1990s.

AllMusic states that alternative dance mixes the ""melodic song structure of alternative and indie rock with electronic beats, synths and/or samples, and club orientation of post-disco dance music"".[6]The Sacramento Bee calls it ""postmodern–Eurosynth–technopop–New Wave in a blender"".[2]

The genre draws heavily on club culture for inspiration while incorporating other styles of music such as electropop, house, and EBM. The performers of alternative dance are closely identified with their music through a signature style, texture, or fusion of specific musical elements.[6] They are usually signed to small record labels.[7]

Many of the alternative dance artists are British, ""owing to the greater prominence of the UK's club and rave scenes in underground musical culture"". New Order are cited by AllMusic as the genre's first group because of their 1982–83 recordings, which merged post-punk with electro/synth pop in the style of German group Kraftwerk. Alternative dance had a major impact on Britain's late-1980s Madchester scene (adapted from Manchester, New Order's home city) and 1990s trip hop and rave scenes.[6]The Haçienda club in Manchester, founded by New Order and Factory Records, became the hub of the genre in 1980s Britain.[8] Meanwhile, indie-orientated acts such as Saint Etienne, Dubstar, Space and White Town also explored dance beats and rhythms in their music.

The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Brothers are prominent examples of British artists[9][10] in the post-Madchester-era, who crossed over from the dance music world to alternative,[11] with most of their releases falling under the big beat music genre in the mid 1990s.[12][13][14][15][16][17] Of the three acts, the Prodigy had the first international alternative dance hit when their third studio album The Fat of the Land debuted at number one in 25 countries, including the US, in 1997.[9] Also finding international success in the 1990s was Icelandic musician Björk, a former member of indie band the Sugarcubes, whose solo albums Debut (1993) and Post (1995), incorporated alternative dance elements and featured production from artists like Tricky, Howie B and 808 State's Graham Massey.[18]

In the US, Chicago's Liquid Soul to San Francisco's Dubtribe expanded dance music ""beyond its old identity as a singles-driven genre with no identifiable, long-term artists"".[5] The American scene rarely received radio airplay and most of the innovative work continued underground or was imported.[7]

As computer technology and music software became more accessible and advanced at the start of the 21st century, bands tended to forgo traditional studio production practices. High quality music was often conceived using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances led to an increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music, including alternative dance, available via the Internet.[19] According to BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, part of the strength of the scene in the new millennium was ""the sense of community""; she noted, ""Websites, blogs and Myspace pages all get people talking about records and checking out each other's recommendations. It's not like the old club scene, where these established DJs dictated what would be big. Word-of-mouth is so important now.""[20]

In the early 2000s, the term ""electroclash"" was used to denote artists such as Fischerspooner and Ladytron who mixed new wave with electronic music. The Electroclash festival was held in New York in 2001 and 2002, with subsequent tours across the US and Europe in 2003 and 2004.[21] In the mid-2000s, the British music magazine NME popularised the term ""new rave"" (""new wave"" and ""rave"") to describe the music of bands such as Klaxons, whose rock aesthetic includes paraphernalia from the 1990s rave scene such as glowsticks and neon lights.[22]"
"Madchester","



Madchester was a musical and cultural scene that developed in the English city of Manchester in the late 1980s, closely associated with the indie dance scene.[1][2][3][4] Indie-dance (sometimes referred to as indie-rave[5]) saw artists merging indie music with elements of acid house, psychedelia[6] and 1960s pop.[7] The term Madchester was coined by Factory Records' Tony Wilson,[8][9][10] with the label popularised by the British music press in the early 1990s,[11] and its most famous groups include the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans, James and 808 State. It is widely seen as being heavily influenced by drugs, especially MDMA. At that time, the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, was a major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love.[12]

The music scene in Manchester immediately before the Madchester era had been dominated by the Smiths, New Order, and the Fall, who were to become a significant influence on the Madchester scene. The May 1982 opening of the Haçienda nightclub, an initiative of Factory Records, was also influential in the development of popular culture in Manchester. For the first few years of its life, the club played predominantly club-oriented pop music and hosted gigs by artists including New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Culture Club, Thompson Twins, and the Smiths. It had DJs such as Hewan Clarke and Greg Wilson and switched focus from being a live venue to being a dance club by 1986.[13] In 1987, the Hacienda started playing house music with DJs Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and ""Little"" Martin Prendergast hosting ""Nude Night"" on Fridays.[14]

The Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986, organised by Factory Records, helped to consolidate Manchester's standing as a centre for alternative pop culture. The festival included film screenings, a music seminar, art shows, and gigs by the city's most prominent bands, including an all-day gig at Manchester G-Mex featuring A Certain Ratio, the Smiths, New Order, and the Fall. According to Dave Haslam, the festival demonstrated that ""the city had become synonymous with larger-than-life characters playing cutting edge music. [...] Individuals were inspired and the city was energised; of it's [sic] own accord, uncontrolled"".[15]

The Haçienda went from making a consistent loss to selling out by early 1987.[16] During 1987, it hosted performances by American house artists including Frankie Knuckles and Adonis.[17] Other clubs in the Manchester area started to catch on to house music including Devilles, Isadora's, Konspiracy, House, Soundgardens and Man Alive in the city centre, Bugsy's in Ashton-under-Lyne and the Osbourne Club in Miles Platting. Another key factor in the build-up to Madchester was the sudden availability of the drug MDMA in the city, beginning in 1987 and growing the following year.[18] According to Haslam, ""[MDMA] use changed clubs forever; a night at the Haçienda went from being a great night out to an intense, life changing experience"".[19]

The British music scene was such that The Guardian later stated, ""The '80s looked destined to end in musical ignominy"".[20] The Madchester movement burgeoned as its sound was new and refreshing, and its popularity soon grew.[21] Music by artists such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays began to chart highly in 1989 with New Order releasing the acid house-influenced Technique, which topped the UK Albums Chart.

In October 1988, the Stone Roses released ""Elephant Stone"" as a single. Around the same time, the Happy Mondays released the single ""Wrote for Luck"" (followed by the Bummed album, produced by Martin Hannett). In November, A Guy Called Gerald released his first solo single, ""Voodoo Ray"". Only ""Voodoo Ray"" was a commercial success; by December of that year, however, a sense had started to develop in the British music press that there was something going on in the city. According to Sean O'Hagan, writing in the NME, ""There is a particularly credible music biz rumour-come [sic] theory that certain Northern towns—Manchester being the prime example—have had their water supply treated with small doses of mind-expanding chemicals. [...] Everyone from Happy Mondays to the severely disorientated Morrissey conform to the theory in some way. Enter A Guy Called Gerald, out of his box on the limitless possibilities of a bank of keyboards.""[22]

The Stone Roses' following increased as they gigged around the country and released the ""Made of Stone"" single in February 1989.[23] This did not chart, but enthusiasm for the band in the music press intensified when they released their debut album (produced by John Leckie) in March. Bob Stanley (later of Saint Etienne), reviewing the Stone Roses album in Melody Maker, wrote, ""This is simply the best debut LP I've heard in my record buying lifetime. Forget everybody else. Forget work tomorrow.""[24]NME did not put it quite so strongly, but reported nonetheless that it was being talked of as ""the greatest album ever made"". John Robb in Sounds gave the album 9/10 and said that the Stone Roses ""revolutionised British pop"".

The club scene in Manchester continued to grow during 1988 and 1989, with the Haçienda launching Ibiza-themed nights in the summer of 1988 and the ""Hot"" acid house night (hosted by Mike Pickering and Jon DaSilva) in November of the same year.

The ""baggy"" sound generally includes a combination of funk, psychedelia, guitar rock, and house music. In the Manchester context, the music can be seen as mainly influenced by the indie music that had dominated the city's music scene during the 1980s, but also absorbing the various influences coming through ""the Haçienda"" nightclub. Alongside the music, a way of dressing emerged that gave baggy its name. Baggy jeans (often flared, with the pants usually being made by Shami Ahmed's 'Joe Bloggs' brand[25][26][27]) alongside brightly coloured or tie-dye casual tops and general 1960s style became fashionable first in Manchester and then across the country,[28] frequently topped off with a fishing hat in the style sported by the Stone Roses' drummer Alan ""Reni"" Wren. The overall look was part rave, part retro or part hippie, part football casual. Many Madchester bands had football casual fans and a number of bands even wore football shirts.[29]

In mid-1989, media interest in the Manchester scene continued to grow. In September, the Happy Mondays released a Vince Clarke remix of ""Wrote for Luck"" as a single. In November, four important singles were released: ""Move"" by the Inspiral Carpets, ""Pacific State"" by 808 State, the Happy Mondays EP Madchester Rave On and ""Fools Gold""/""What the World is Waiting For"" by the Stone Roses. The Happy Mondays record, featuring the lead track ""Hallelujah!"", publicised the term ""Madchester"" – it had originally been suggested by their video directors the Bailey Brothers as a potential T-shirt slogan, after they had coined the word for their abandoned Factory film The Mad Fuckers.[30]

In November, the Stone Roses performed a gig at London's Alexandra Palace and were invited onto BBC Two's high-brow Late Show (during their performance the electricity was cut off by noise limiting circuitry and singer Ian Brown shouted ""Amateurs, amateurs"" as the presenter tried to link into the next item). On 23 November 1989, the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays appeared on the same edition of Top of the Pops. The ""Fools Gold"" single made number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the biggest-selling indie single of the year.[31]

Madchester became something of an industry bandwagon from this time. According to NME journalist Stuart Maconie, the British press had ""gone bonkers over Manchester bands"".[32]James were amongst the first beneficiaries of this. The local success of their self-financed singles ""Come Home"" and ""Sit Down"" led to a deal with Fontana, and they were to score chart hits with ""How Was It for You"" and a re-recorded version of ""Come Home"" in the summer of 1990.

The Charlatans came to prominence through appearances in Manchester, particularly as a support act to the Stone Roses and became strongly associated with the scene. They released a debut single ""Indian Rope"" in October 1989 and their second ""The Only One I Know"" made the UK top ten. A number of other Manchester bands gained the attention of the music press during 1990, including World of Twist, New Fast Automatic Daffodils, the High, Northside, the Paris Angels, and Intastella. These ""second wave"" bands, according to John Robb, ""copped the critical backlash, but were making great music"".[33] and they also received a great deal of local support with TV appearances on various Granada shows and local radio play.

Bands associated with the Madchester scene released material almost exclusively on indie records labels, with the significant exception of James, who signed to Fontana Records in 1989. Madchester was growing in popularity and was not just a local trend in Manchester with an article entitled ""Stark Raving Madchester"" appearing in Newsweek Magazine in 1990 describing the Madchester scene.[34] The main Madchester bands dominated the UK Indie Charts during late 1989 and much of 1990.

The success on the UK Singles and Albums charts of a number of indie acts associated with a ""scene"" was unprecedented at the time. ""Step On"" and ""Kinky Afro"" by the Happy Mondays both made number 5 on the singles chart, whilst James scored the biggest Madchester hit, making number 2 in 1991 with a re-recording of ""Sit Down"". On the albums chart, the Happy Mondays made number 4 with Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, and the Inspiral Carpets got to number 2 with Life. The Charlatans were the only Madchester band to take the number 1 spot, with the album Some Friendly in the autumn of 1990.

Outside the UK, the success of Madchester was limited, although some releases gained recognition in specialist charts around the world. In the U.S., the albums The Stone Roses, Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches and Some Friendly reached the lower echelons of the U.S. albums chart. Several singles by the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets, the Happy Mondays and the Charlatans were successful on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The Happy Mondays toured the US in 1990 and charted on the Billboard Hot 100 with ""Step On"" reaching No. 57 in 1990. They also reached No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with ""Kinky Afro"" in 1990. The only other Madchester artist to reach No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart was the Charlatans, whose single ""Weirdo"" was No. 1 for the week of 23 May 1992.

On 27 May 1990, the Stone Roses performed at Spike Island in Widnes, supported by DJs Frankie Bones, Dave Haslam, Phonso Buller, and Dave Booth. The concert was described as a ""Woodstock for the E generation"".[35] A rapid succession of chart hits followed during the summer, including ""One Love"" by the Stone Roses, ""This Is How It Feels"" by the Inspiral Carpets, ""The Only One I Know"" by the Charlatans, and ""Kinky Afro"" by the Happy Mondays. The end of the year saw triumphant concerts by James and a double-header with the Happy Mondays and 808 State, both at Manchester G-Mex.

The Stone Roses cancelled their June 1990 tour of America and issued a press statement saying, ""America doesn't deserve us yet"".[36] However, their debut album sold more than 350,000 copies in the U.S. that year. The band also cancelled a gig in Spain and an appearance on the UK chat show Wogan. They did not face the public again until the end of 1994, spending the intervening time in and out of studios in Wales, where they recorded the album Second Coming, and fighting in court to release themselves from their contract with Silvertone Records.

The making of the next Happy Mondays album, Yes Please! was also problematic, and it would not be released until October 1992. The band flew to Barbados to record it, and went ""crack crazy"" according to Paul Ryder,[37] making repeated requests to Factory Records for extra time and additional funds. This is reputed to have been the major factor in the bankruptcy of the label in November 1992.[38]

With the two bands seen as the most central to the scene out of action, media fascination with Madchester dwindled. James, the Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans, and 808 State continued to record with varying degrees of success during the 1990s, but ceased to be seen as part of a localised scene. Local bands catching the tail-end of Madchester, such as the Mock Turtles, became part of a wider baggy scene. The music press in the UK began to place more focus on shoegazing bands from southern England and the U.S. grunge scene, which in turn was overtaken by Britpop acts such as Manchester's Oasis and London's Blur.

Psychedelic film

The immediate influence of Madchester was an inspiration to the wider baggy movement in the UK, with bands from various parts of the country producing music in the early 1990s heavily influenced by the main Madchester players. These bands included Flowered Up (from London), the Farm and the Real People (from Liverpool), the Bridewell Taxis (from Leeds), the Soup Dragons (from Glasgow) and Ocean Colour Scene (from Birmingham). Blur, from Colchester, adopted a baggy style in their early career, although in an interview with Select Magazine in 1991 they claimed to have ""killed"" the genre.[39] Blur famously shared a rivalry throughout the 1990s with fellow Britpop band Oasis, who hailed from Manchester.[40]

Bands formed in Manchester during the Madchester era included the Chemical Brothers, the Verve, Sub Sub (who would later become Doves) and Oasis (Noel Gallagher had been a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets). More generally, the Madchester scene brought together electronic dance music and alternative rock, in particular the combination of the types of drumming found in funk and disco music (and sampled in '80s hip-hop music) with jingle-jangle guitar. In the 1990s, this became a commonplace formula, found frequently in even the most commercial music.

There have been numerous polls in the years following the Madchester movement to find the best song of the era. In 2005, ""Voodoo Ray"" by A Guy Called Gerald was voted as the best song from the Madchester scene.[41] The song beat ""Step On"" by the Happy Mondays and ""Waterfall"" by the Stone Roses for first place.[41]

In 2010, a new nightclub managed by Peter Hook of New Order, FAC251 opened in Manchester, with musical emphasis on Madchester music.[42][43] Although Madchester faded by the mid-1990s, various bands have reformed for one-off concert tours. Notable bands which reformed in 2012 include the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays and the Inspiral Carpets.[44]

The Guardian critic Penny Anderson looked unfavourably upon the scene, calling it a ""breeding ground for aggressively marketed mediocrity"".[45]

The sound of the scene influenced the electronic and dance-influenced album by U2, Achtung Baby. Elysa Gardner of Rolling Stone compared the layering of dance beats into guitar-heavy mixes of the album to songs by British bands Happy Mondays and Jesus Jones. ""Mysterious Ways"" combines a funky guitar riff with a danceable, conga-laden beat,[46] for what Bono called ""U2 at our funkiest... Sly and the Family Stone meets Madchester baggy"".[47] It also influenced the Cure's song ""Never Enough"".[48]

The mushrooming of Manchester's nightlife during the Madchester period has had a long-term impact, particularly with the subsequent development of the Gay Village and Northern Quarter. City centre living is also something that began to catch on in Manchester in the wake of Madchester, and which continues to this day.[49]

The attraction of the city was such that, at the height of Madchester in 1990 the University of Manchester was the most sought-after destination for university applicants in the UK.[citation needed]

The scene also gave a boost to the city's media and creative industries. Channel 4 already had great success with The Word and in its wake the BBC launched The 8:15 from Manchester, a Saturday morning kids' TV show (with a theme tune by the Inspiral Carpets, a re-write of ""Find out Why"") and Granada Television also jumped on the bandwagon with a cheaper version of The Word, called Juice presented by John Bramwell and Joan Collins' daughter Tara Newley.

Organised crime became a consequence of Madchester, with the vibrancy of the clubbing scene in the city (and the popularity of illegal drugs, particularly ecstasy) providing a fertile environment for opportunist gangsterism. Violent incidents at the Haçienda led to a campaign against it by Greater Manchester Police, and contributed to its closure in 1997.[50]

In the late 1990s, a Manchester musical walk of fame was commissioned for Oldham Street in the Northern Quarter of Manchester.[51] The walk includes a triangular slab for each music group and pays homage to bands such as the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, the Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, and James.[51]

A blue plaque marks the site of The Boardwalk, another club seminal to the Madchester scene, where Oasis played their first gig and Dave Haslam hosted the Yellow club night until the club's closure in 1999. It reads ""Madchester venue nightclub and rehearsal rooms"" and features a yellow smiley face beneath. Funkademia, a club night that began at the Boardwalk in 1995, is now still held at Mint Lounge in the Northern Quarter."
"New rave","New rave (also typeset as nu-rave, nu rave or neu rave)[1][2][3][4][5] is a genre of music described by The Guardian as ""an in-yer-face, DIY disco riposte to the sensitive indie rock touted by bands like Bloc Party.""[6] It is most commonly applied to a British-based music scene between 2005 and late 2008 of fast-paced electronica-influenced indie music that celebrated the late 1980s Madchester and rave scenes through the use of neon colours and using the term 'raving' to refer to going nightclubbing.

The British music magazine NME is largely responsible for popularising the term throughout 2006 and 2007, until claiming in mid-2008 reviews that ""New Rave is over"". The genre has connotations of being a ""new"" version of music heard at raves, as well as being a play on the term ""new wave"".[7]

The aesthetics of the new rave scene are similar to those of the original rave scene, being mostly centred on psychedelic visual effects. Glowsticks, neon and other lights are common, and followers of the scene often dress in extremely bright and fluorescent colored clothing.[6][8] New Rave has been defined more by the image and aesthetic of its bands and supporters, than by its music. Trash Fashion lead singer Jet Storm and Electro heroine Uffie have been described as the scene's very own pin ups.[9][10] Nevertheless, the use of electronic instruments, a musical fusion of rock and dance styles, and a particular anarchic, trashy energy are certainly key elements.[citation needed]

Klaxons,[6][11][12][13][14][15]Trash Fashion,[9]New Young Pony Club,[16]Hadouken!, Late of the Pier and Shitdisco[6] are generally accepted as the main exponents of the genre (although some of them disavow the term entirely).

The term was coined by Klaxons founder Jamie Reynolds. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a ""joke that's got out of hand"".[8][17][18] In reaction to the media overkill of the ""genre"", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that ""We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave was to take the piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but can you tell me more about new rave?""[19]Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the ""minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of !!! (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy"" contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.[20]

The sound of the original rave style is barely (if at all) discernible (save some typical analog synth lines) in the majority of bands referred to as new rave. Bands such as The Sunshine Underground,[21]CSS (Cansei de Ser Sexy)[22][23][24][25] and Hot Chip[26] are often labeled as new rave due to their large following by fans of the genre. M.I.A. has been described as ""a new raver before it was old.""[27] Several have publicly declared they had nothing to do with the genre. Stylist Carri Mundane described it as funny, saying New Rave was ""Vacant in retro. It’s just a marketing machine.... I guess it was a fun time but I’m more excited about what happens now. The next level - the next generation. There’s a mood of neo-spiritualism and futurism that excites me.""[28]

The new rave scene can be viewed as a media construct, largely propounded by the NME and TRAX [fr], with other publications treating the subject as a joke.[13] The belief that many of the bands associated with new rave can more appropriately be associated with the genre of dance-punk has given credence to such suggestions, although differences between both genres are said to be minor and more down to aesthetics. Critic John Harris has stated in The Guardian newspaper that the genre is nothing more than a ""piss-poor supposed 'youthquake'"" that will soon go out of fashion in the same way as rave.[13]"
"Sophisti-pop","

Sophisti-pop is a pop music subgenre that developed during the mid-1980s out of the British new wave era.[1] It originated with acts who blended elements of jazz, soul, and pop with lavish production.[2][3] The term ""sophisti-pop"" was coined only after the genre's peak in the mid-late 1980s.[4]

Sophisti-pop is characterized by its extensive use of electronic keyboards, synthesizers and polished arrangements.[2] Artists also utilized cutting-edge studio technology and perfectionist recording methods.[5] The genre has been described as mellow, romantic, and atmospheric,[5]  with artists often adopting a sharp, well-dressed and well-groomed visual presentation.

Stylus Magazine suggested that acts had been influenced by the work of Roxy Music (such as 1982's Avalon, often cited as the first sophisti-pop album[5]) and Bryan Ferry's Bête Noire (1987) and Boys and Girls (1985).[6]

Sweetwater named major artists in the genre as including the Blue Nile, Prefab Sprout, the Style Council, Scritti Politti, Everything but the Girl, and Danny Wilson.[5]AllMusic added Simply Red, Sade, Basia, and Swing Out Sister.[2] Writer Iain Munn added to the list Level 42, the Blow Monkeys, and Joe Jackson's 1984 album Body and Soul.[7]

Its popularity declined in the 1990s along with other synth-pop sub-genres.[1]"
"Electropop","

Electropop is a popular music fusion genre  combining elements of the electronic and pop styles. It has been described as a variant of synth-pop with outstanding heavy emphasis on its electronic sound.[3] The genre was developed in the 1980s and saw a revival of popularity and influence in the late 2000s.[3]

During the early 1980s, British artists such as Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, The Human League, Soft Cell, John Foxx and Visage helped pioneer a new synth-pop style that drew more heavily from electronic music and emphasized primary usage of synthesizers.[4]

Some fascinating new music began arriving on these shores; it was dubbed electropop, because electronic instrumentation — mainly synthesizers and syndrums — was used to craft pop songs. ""Pop Muzik"" by M was one of the first. There was a gradual accumulation of worthy electropop discs, though they were still mostly heard only in rock discos. But in 1981, the floodgates opened, and ""new music"" at last made a mighty splash. The breakthrough song was ""Don't You Want Me"" by the Human League.

Britney Spears' highly influential fifth studio album Blackout (2007) is credited for bringing the genre to mainstream prominence. The media in 2009 ran articles proclaiming a new era of different electropop stars, and indeed the times saw a rise in popularity of several electropop artists. In the Sound of 2009 poll of 130 music experts conducted for the BBC, ten of the top fifteen artists named were of the electropop genre.[6]Lady Gaga had major commercial success from 2008 with her debut album The Fame. Music writer Simon Reynolds noted that ""Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s"".[7] The Korean pop music scene has also become dominated and influenced by electropop, particularly with boy bands and girl groups such as Super Junior, SHINee, f(x) and Girls' Generation.[8]

Singer Michael Angelakos of Passion Pit said in a 2009 interview that while playing electropop was not his intention, the limitations of dorm life made the genre more accessible.[9]

In 2009, The Guardian quoted James Oldham—head of artists and repertoire at A&M Records—as saying ""All A&R departments have been saying to managers and lawyers: 'Don't give us any more bands because we're not going to sign them and they're not going to sell records.' So everything we've been put on to is electronic in nature.""[10][11]

In 2019, Kenneth Womack wrote that singer and songwriter Billie Eilish had ""staked her claim as the reigning queen of electropop"" with her critical and commercial hit album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?.[12]

"Hyperpop","

Hyperpop  is a loosely defined electronic music movement[1][4] and microgenre[5] that predominantly originated in the United Kingdom during the early 2010s. It is characterised by a maximalist or exaggerated take on popular music,[4] and artists within the microgenre typically integrate pop and avant-garde sensibilities while drawing on elements commonly found in electronic, hip hop, and dance music.[6]

Deriving influence from a varied range of sources, the origins of the hyperpop scene are commonly traced to the output of English musician A. G. Cook's record label and collective PC Music and its associated artists such as Sophie and Charli XCX.[6] Music associated with this scene received wider attention in August 2019 when Spotify used the term ""hyperpop"" as the name of a playlist featuring artists such as Cook and 100 gecs.[5] The microgenre spread within younger audiences through social media platforms, especially TikTok.[7]

Hyperpop reflects an exaggerated, eclectic, and self-referential approach to pop music and typically employs elements such as brash synth melodies, Auto-Tuned ""earworm"" vocals, and excessive compression and distortion, as well as surrealist or nostalgic references to 2000s Internet culture and the Web 2.0 era.[6] Common features include vocals that are heavily processed; metallic, melodic percussion sounds; pitch-shifted synths; catchy choruses; short song lengths; and ""shiny, cutesy aesthetics"" juxtaposed with angst-ridden lyrics.[6]The Wall Street Journal's Mark Richardson described the genre as intensifying the ""artificial"" tropes of popular music, resulting in ""a cartoonish wall of noise that embraces catchy tunes and memorable hooks. The music zooms between beauty and ugliness, as shimmery melodies collide with mangled instrumentation.""[8] Writing for American Songwriter, Joe Vitagliano described it as ""an exciting, bombastic and iconoclastic genre — if it can even be called a 'genre'—[...] featuring ""saw synths, auto-tuned vocals, glitch-inspired percussion and a distinctive late-capitalism-dystopia vibe.""[4] Artists often ""straddle the avant-garde and the pop charts simultaneously.""[6]

According to Vice journalist Eli Enis, hyperpop is less rooted in musical technicalities than ""a shared ethos of transcending genre altogether, while still operating within the context of pop.""[1] Artists in the style reflect a ""tendency to rehabilitate styles of music that have long since gone out of fashion, constantly poking at what is or isn't 'cool' or artful.""[6] The style may blend elements from a range of styles, including bubblegum pop, trance, Eurohouse, emo rap, nu metal, cloud rap, J-pop and K-pop.[6] The influence of cloud rap, emo and lo-fi trap, trance music, dubstep, and chiptune are evident in hyperpop, as well as more surreal and haphazard qualities that are pulled heavily from hip hop since the mid-2010s.[1]The Atlantic noted the way the microgenre ""swirls together and speeds up Top 40 tricks of present and past: a Janet Jackson drum slam here, a Depeche Mode synth squeal there, the overblown pep of novelty jingles throughout,"" but also noted ""the genre's zest for punk's brattiness, hip-hop's boastfulness, and metal's noise.""[9] Some of the style's more surreal and off kilter qualities drew from 2010s hip-hop.[1]

Hyperpop is often linked to the LGBTQ+ community and queer aesthetics.[6] Several of its key practitioners identify as gay, non-binary, or transgender.[9] The microgenre's emphasis on vocal modulation has allowed artists to experiment with the gender presentation of their voices.[6] ""Digicore"" and ""Glitchcore"" are contemporaneous movements that are sometimes conflated with ""hyperpop"" due to its overlapping artists.[10]

The first instance of the term ""hyperpop"" was seemingly coined on October 1988 by writer Don Shewey in an article about the Scottish dream pop band Cocteau Twins,[11] stating that England in the 1980s had ""nurtured the simultaneous phenomena of hyperpop and antipop"".[12]

Complex has stated that ""the origins of hyperpop are tangled and murky in the way that things conceived on the internet often are.""[10] ""Hyperpop"" was sometimes used within SoundCloud's nightcore music scene as a genre descriptor.[1]Spotify analyst Glenn McDonald stated that he first saw the term used in reference to the UK-based label PC Music in 2014, but believed that the name did not qualify as a microgenre until 2018.[5] Despite many other artists and labels influencing the scene such as Meishi Smile and Maltine Records,[13] the origins of the style are usually located to the mid-2010s output of PC Music, with hyperpop artists either being affiliated with or directly inspired by the label.[5][14]The Independent's Will Pritchard stated that ""it's possible to see [hyperpop] as an expression not just of the genres it borrows from, but of the scene that evolved around A. G. Cook's PC Music label (an early home to Sophie and Charli XCX, among others) in the UK in the early 2010s.""[6]

There were many other predecessors to the genre, as explained by Pritchard, ""to some, the ground covered by hyperpop won't seem all that new"". He cited ""outliers"" of 2000s nu rave (such as Test Icicles) and PC Music contemporaries Rustie and Hudson Mohawke as pursuing similar approaches; of the latter two artists, he noted that their ""fluoro, trance-edged smooshes of dance and hip-hop are reminiscent of a lot of hyperpop today.""  Another artist who has heavily influenced the hyperpop scene is Yasutaka Nakata.[13] Heather Phares of AllMusic stated that the work of Sleigh Bells foreshadowed hyperpop and other artists who ""brazenly ignored genre boundaries and united the extremes of sweet and heavy;""[15] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork similarly stated that the term described Sleigh Bells before it became a dominant microgenre.[16] Eilish Gilligan of Junkee credited Kesha for impacting the microgenre, stating that her ""grating, half-spoken vocal featured in ['Blow'] and all of her early work, in fact, feel reminiscent of a lot of the intense vocals in hyperpop today"", as well as Britney Spears, whose ""2011 dancefloor fillers 'Till The World Ends', 'Hold It Against Me' and 'I Wanna Go' all share the same pounding beats that populate modern hyperpop.""[17]

Spotify editor Lizzy Szabo referred to A. G. Cook as the ""godfather"" of hyperpop.[1] According to Enis, PC Music ""laid the groundwork for [the microgenre's] melodic exuberance and cartoonish production"", with some of hyperpop's surrealist qualities also derived from 2010s hip hop.[1] She states that hyperpop built on the influence of PC Music, but also incorporated the sounds of emo rap, cloud rap, trap, trance, dubstep and chiptune.[1] Among Cook's frequent collaborators, Variety and The New York Times described the work of Sophie as pioneering the style,[18][19] while Charli XCX was described as ""queen"" of the style by Vice, and her 2017 mixtape Pop 2 set a template for its sound, featuring ""outré"" production by Cook, Sophie, Umru, and Easyfun as well as  ""a titular mission to give pop – sonically, spiritually, aesthetically – a facelift for the modern age.""[1]

In May 2019, hyperpop duo 100 gecs released their debut album 1000 gecs (2019), which amassed millions of listens on streaming services and helped to consolidate the style. In Pritchard's description, 100 Gecs took hyperpop ""to its most extreme, and extremely catchy, conclusions: stadium-sized trap beats processed and distorted to near-destruction, overwrought emo vocals and cascades of ravey arpeggios.""[6] According to Vice and The Face, a second wave of the genre emerged in 2019 following the release of 1000 gecs.[20][21]

In August 2019, Spotify launched the ""Hyperpop"" playlist which further cemented the microgenre, and featured guest curation from 100 Gecs and others.[5] Other artists featured on the playlist included Cook, Slayyyter, Gupi, Caroline Polachek, Hannah Diamond, and Kim Petras.[22] Spotify editor Lizzy Szabo and her colleagues landed on the name for their August 2019 playlist after McDonald noted the term in the website's metadata and classified it as a microgenre.[5] In November, Cook added artists including J Dilla, Nicki Minaj, Lil Uzi Vert and Kate Bush to the playlist, which caused controversy due to these additions pushing out smaller hyperpop artists who relied upon the playlist for their earnings.[5][23] In addition, David Turner, a former strategy manager at SoundCloud, noted a ""spike in March and April 2020 from new creators,"" on the platform, many of which were making hyperpop-adjacent music.[24]

The microgenre began to see rise in popularity in 2020, with the prominence of the Spotify playlist and its spread within younger audiences on social media, such as on TikTok,[7][25] particularly 'alt Tiktok', one of the main countercultures on the app.[26] In 2022, Ringtone Mag suggested that part of the reason the microgenre rose in popularity across the platform was due to its nature of favouring heavy beats to which creators could dance and make transitions.[27] Hyperpop albums like Charli XCX's How I'm Feeling Now (2020) and A. G. Cook's Apple (2020) appeared on critics' 2020 end-of-year lists.[6] Hyperpop artist ElyOtto's song ""SugarCrash!"" became one of the most popular songs in the app's history, and was used in over 5 million videos on the platform by July 2021.[11]

Internationally, hyperpop gained notoriety in Hispanic countries, such as Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Spain, particularly with Spanish-speaking artists and producers. Nylon's Ben Jolley cited Putochinomaricón as one of the ""biggest names in the scene.""[28]

Questions concerning the potential decline of the microgenre, the corporate influences upon it, and the meaning of the 'hyperpop' name, began to be raised in 2021.[10] Charli XCX, in August 2021, posted a tweet asking ""rip hyperpop? discuss"".[21][29] In 2022, Dazed noted that since 2019, the word 'hyperpop' ""has since become a catch-all phrase for any and all forms of extreme pop music,"" and that ""sonically, you'd be hard pressed to find any internet-born music made in the last decade that hasn't been retroactively brandished as hyperpop"", also stating that ""almost all of those given the label have grown disillusioned with the term, or grown irritated by its constraints.""[30] The same year, prominent hyperpop musician Glaive stated that he and Ericdoa were ""working on killing"" the movement,[20] though three months later stated that it ""will never die.""[31] He later stated that the packaging of the community within the name 'hyperpop' for profit led to its music becoming ""algorithmic"" over time.[24] In June of 2023, PC Music announced that after that year, the label would not be releasing new music, instead turning to archival projects and special reissues.[32] In September 2023 Underscores, another significant contributor to the microgenre, stated that it was ""officially dead"".[33]

Digicore is a microgenre related to hyperpop.[34] The term (""digi"" is short for ""digital"") was adopted in the mid-2010s by an online community of teenage musicians, communicating through Discord, to distinguish themselves from the preexisting hyperpop scene.[10] It differs from hyperpop mainly through the racial identities of its artists but there remains a degree of crossover between the scenes.[10] Artists often pull from a variety of genres such as midwestern emo, trance, and Chicago drill, amongst others.[35] The beginnings of digicore are rooted in internet culture and many popular producers from the microgenre are between the ages of 15 and 18 who use platforms such as Discord to interact.[35] In 2018, Dalton (a digicore artist relations figure) started a Minecraft and Discord server called ""Loser's Club"" that became a haven for several of the most popular artists within the digicore scene such as Quinn, Glaive, Ericdoa, Funeral, Midwxst, and Angelus.[35] This sense of community and collaboration have become key tenets within the scene, and have contributed to the rise in the popularity of the microgenre as a whole, with a majority of the scene preferring the idea of rising in popularity as a collective rather than as individuals.[35] In 2021, the digicore album Frailty by Jane Remover received praise on mainstream music sites Pitchfork and Paste.[36][37]

Glitchcore, a microgenre related to hyperpop[34] and digicore (sometimes characterised as a subgenre of both styles), is often characterised by high-pitched vocals, sharp 808s, and frequent hi-hats. As one article stated, ""Glitchcore is Hyperpop on steroids"",[38] referring to the exaggerated vocals, distortions, glitch noises, and other pop elements present within Glitchcore. One of the most defining elements of glitchcore is vocal glitch patterns, created by rapidly repeating a section of a vocal sample.

Stef, a producer of the popular Hyperpop and glitchcore collective 'Helix Tears' stated that there certainly is a difference between the two microgenres, saying ""Hyperpop is more melodic and poppy"" while ""Glitchcore is indescribable"".[38] Similar to digicore, glitchcore is typically made up of a younger group of artists than traditional Hyperpop.[39] The artist Twikipedia became a major pioneer of the microgenre, incorporating hyperpop's traditional heavily processed vocals with an 8-bit inspired sound.

TikTok played a key role in popularising glitchcore, through video edits to two viral glitchcore songs ""NEVER MET!"" by CMTEN and Glitch Gum and ""Pressure"" by David Shawty and Yungster Jack.[39] Glitchcore has also been associated with a specific visual aesthetic where videos are typically accompanied by glitchy, fast-paced, cluttered, colourful edits that are even marked with flash warnings in certain cases.[39] Some popular digicore artists like d0llywood1 even refer to glitchcore as ""an aesthetic, like the edits"", rather than an actual music genre.[40]

Hyper Mandelão, or Hyperfunky,[41][42] is the result of the fusion of mandelão, a subgenre from funk carioca and slap house, with hyperpop and influence of industrial music. The main artists of this style are DJ Mu540, DJ Ramemes[43] and Pabllo Vittar.

Dariacore, also known as hyperflip, is a microgenre related to hyperpop.[34] It was coined by Jane Remover following her 2021 album Dariacore and its two sequels, Dariacore 2: Enter Here, Hell to the Left and Dariacore 3... At least I think that's what it's called?. The microgenre gained popularity on SoundCloud in 2021 and 2022. Dariacore is characterised by sped up and pitch-shifted samples from pop music and other popular media, breakbeats, and Jersey club influence.[44] The genre was described by Raphael Helfand of The Fader as ""an entire genre in and of itself, taking hyperpop's silliest tendencies to their logical conclusions"".[45]

Krushclub is a microgenre of underground music that garnered attention on TikTok in the mid-2020s. This microgenre is a fusion of several distinct musical styles, including electronic dance music, HexD, and Jersey club, and is notable for incorporating elements from house music, techno, crunkcore and electropop.[46][47][48]

Musicians such as Lumi Athena, Odetari, cade clair, asteria, Britney Manson, 9lives, Ayesha Erotica, removeface, jnhygs, kyszenn, and kets4eki saw niche success thanks to websites like SoundCloud and TikTok.[49][50][51]"
"Electronica","Electronica is both a broad group of electronic-based music styles intended for listening rather than strictly for dancing[2][1] and a music scene that came to prominence in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom.[1] In the United States, the term is mostly used to refer to electronic music generally.[3]

The original widespread use of the term ""electronica"" derives from the influential English experimental techno label New Electronica, which was one of the leading forces of the early 1990s introducing and supporting dance-based electronic music oriented towards home listening rather than dance-floor play,[1] although the word ""electronica"" had already begun to be associated with synthesizer generated music as early as 1983, when a ""UK Electronica Festival"" was first held.[4][5][6] At that time electronica became known as ""electronic listening music"", also becoming more or less synonymous to ambient techno and intelligent techno, and was considered distinct from other emerging genres such as jungle and trip hop.[1]

Electronica artists that would later become commercially successful began to record in the late 1980s, before the term had come into common usage, including for example the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers, the Crystal Method, Moby, Underworld and Faithless.[7]

Around the mid-1990s, with the success of the big beat-sound exemplified by the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy in the UK, and spurred by the attention from mainstream artists, including Madonna in her collaboration with William Orbit on her album Ray of Light[8] and Australian singer Dannii Minogue with her 1997 album Girl,[9] music of this period began to be produced with a higher budget, increased technical quality, and with more layers than most other forms of dance music, since it was backed by major record labels and MTV as the ""next big thing"".[10]

According to a 1997 Billboard article, ""the union of the club community and independent labels"" provided the experimental and trend-setting environment in which electronica acts developed and eventually reached the mainstream. It cites American labels such as Astralwerks (the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, the Future Sound of London, Fluke), Moonshine (DJ Keoki), Sims, and City of Angels (the Crystal Method) for playing a significant role in discovering and marketing artists who became popularized in the electronica scene.[11]

Madonna and Björk are said[by whom?] to be responsible for electronica's thrust into mainstream culture, with their albums Ray of Light (Madonna),[8]Post and Homogenic (Björk).

In 1997, the North American mainstream music industry adopted and to some extent manufactured electronica as an umbrella term encompassing styles such as techno, big beat, drum and bass, trip hop, downtempo, and ambient, regardless of whether it was curated by indie labels catering to the ""underground"" nightclub and rave scenes,[11][12] or licensed by major labels and marketed to mainstream audiences as a commercially viable alternative to alternative rock music.[13]

New York City became one center of experimentation and growth for the electronica sound, with DJs and music producers from areas as diverse as Southeast Asia and Brazil bringing their creative work to the nightclubs of that city.[14][15]

Electronica benefited from advancements in music technology, especially electronic musical instruments, synthesizers, music sequencers, drum machines, and digital audio workstations. As the technology developed, it became possible for individuals or smaller groups to produce electronic songs and recordings in smaller studios, even in project studios. At the same time, computers facilitated the use of music ""samples"" and ""loops"" as construction kits for sonic compositions.[16] This led to a period of creative experimentation and the development of new forms, some of which became known as electronica.[17][18] Wide ranges of influences, both sonic and compositional, are combined in electronica recordings.[19]

Electronica includes a wide variety of musical acts and styles, linked by a penchant for overtly electronic production;[20] a range which includes more popular acts such as Björk, Madonna, Goldfrapp and IDM artists such as Autechre, and Aphex Twin.

The North American mainstream music industry uses the term as an umbrella category to refer any dance-based electronic music styles with a potential for pop appeal.[1] However, United States-based AllMusic still categorizes electronica as a top-level genre, stating that it includes danceable grooves, as well as music for headphones and chillout areas.[21]

In other parts of the world, especially in the UK, electronica is also a broad term, but is associated with non-dance-oriented music, including relatively experimental styles of listening electronic music. It partly overlaps what is known chiefly outside the UK as intelligent dance music (IDM).[1]

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, electronica was increasingly used as background scores for television advertisements, initially for automobiles. It was also used for various video games, including the Wipeout series, for which the soundtrack was composed of many popular electronica tracks that helped create more interest in this type of music[22]—and later for other technological and business products such as computers and financial services.[citation needed] Then in 2011, Hyundai Veloster, in association with the Grammys, produced a project that became known as Re:Generation.[23]"
"Electronic music","

Electronic music broadly is a group of music genres that employ electronic musical instruments, circuitry-based music technology and software, or general-purpose electronics (such as personal computers) in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depended entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer. Electromechanical instruments can have mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and electric guitar.[3][4]

The first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and Algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.

During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop, and EDM. In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture.[5] In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.[6]

Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.[7]

At the turn of the 20th century, experimentation with emerging electronics led to the first electronic musical instruments.[8] These initial inventions were not sold, but were instead used in demonstrations and public performances. The audiences were presented with reproductions of existing music instead of new compositions for the instruments.[9] While some were considered novelties and produced simple tones, the Telharmonium synthesized the sound of several orchestral instruments with reasonable precision. It achieved viable public interest and made commercial progress into streaming music through telephone networks.[10]

Critics of musical conventions at the time saw promise in these developments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the composition of microtonal music allowed for by electronic instruments. He predicted the use of machines in future music, writing the influential Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (1907).[11][12]Futurists such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo began composing music with acoustic noise to evoke the sound of machinery. They predicted expansions in timbre allowed for by electronics in the influential manifesto The Art of Noises (1913).[13][14]

Developments of the vacuum tube led to electronic instruments that were smaller, amplified, and more practical for performance.[15] In particular, the theremin, ondes Martenot and trautonium were commercially produced by the early 1930s.[16][17]

From the late 1920s, the increased practicality of electronic instruments influenced composers such as Joseph Schillinger and Maria Schuppel to adopt them. They were typically used within orchestras, and most composers wrote parts for the theremin that could otherwise be performed with string instruments.[16]

Avant-garde composers criticized the predominant use of electronic instruments for conventional purposes.[16] The instruments offered expansions in pitch resources[18] that were exploited by advocates of microtonal music such as Charles Ives, Dimitrios Levidis, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Varèse.[19][20][21] Further, Percy Grainger used the theremin to abandon fixed tonation entirely,[22] while Russian composers such as Gavriil Popov treated it as a source of noise in otherwise-acoustic noise music.[23]

Developments in early recording technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio was invented in the late 19th century with the mechanical phonograph.[24] Record players became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.[25]

The introduction of electrical recording in 1925 was followed by increased experimentation with record players. Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, John Cage composed Imaginary Landscape No. 1 in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.[26]

Composers began to experiment with newly developed sound-on-film technology. Recordings could be spliced together to create sound collages, such as those by Tristan Tzara, Kurt Schwitters, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov. Further, the technology allowed sound to be graphically created and modified. These techniques were used to compose soundtracks for several films in Germany and Russia, in addition to the popular Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in the United States. Experiments with graphical sound were continued by Norman McLaren from the late 1930s.[27]

The first practical audio tape recorder was unveiled in 1935.[28] Improvements to the technology were made using the AC biasing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity.[29][30] As early as 1942, test recordings were being made in stereo.[31] Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders and tapes were brought to the United States following the end of World War II.[32] These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.[33]

In 1944, before the use of magnetic tape for compositional purposes, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh, while still a student in Cairo, used a cumbersome wire recorder to record sounds of an ancient zaar ceremony. Using facilities at the Middle East Radio studios El-Dabh processed the recorded material using reverberation, echo, voltage controls and re-recording. What resulted is believed to be the earliest tape music composition.[34] The resulting work was entitled The Expression of Zaar and it was presented in 1944 at an art gallery event in Cairo. While his initial experiments in tape-based composition were not widely known outside of Egypt at the time, El-Dabh is also known for his later work in electronic music at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the late 1950s.[35]

Following his work with Studio d'Essai at Radiodiffusion Française (RDF), during the early 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer is credited with originating the theory and practice of musique concrète. In the late 1940s, experiments in sound-based composition using shellac record players were first conducted by Schaeffer. In 1950, the techniques of musique concrete were expanded when magnetic tape machines were used to explore sound manipulation practices such as speed variation (pitch shift) and tape splicing.[36][37]

On 5 October 1948, RDF broadcast Schaeffer's Etude aux chemins de fer. This was the first ""movement"" of Cinq études de bruits, and marked the beginning of studio realizations[38] and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disc cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Pierre Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on Déserts, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio and were later revised at Columbia University.

In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrète at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. ""Schaeffer used a PA system, several turntables, and mixers. The performance did not go well, as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before.""[39] Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on Symphonie pour un homme seul (1950) the first major work of musique concrete.[40] In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, Orpheus, for concrete sounds and voices.

By 1951 the work of Schaeffer, composer-percussionist Pierre Henry, and sound engineer Jacques Poullin had received official recognition and The Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète, Club d 'Essai de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française was established at RTF in Paris, the ancestor of the ORTF.[41]

Karlheinz Stockhausen worked briefly in Schaeffer's studio in 1952, and afterward for many years at the WDR Cologne's Studio for Electronic Music.

1954 saw the advent of what would now be considered authentic electric plus acoustic compositions—acoustic instrumentation augmented/accompanied by recordings of manipulated or electronically generated sound. Three major works were premiered that year: Varèse's Déserts, for chamber ensemble and tape sounds, and two works by Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky: Rhapsodic Variations for the Louisville Symphony and A Poem in Cycles and Bells, both for orchestra and tape. Because he had been working at Schaeffer's studio, the tape part for Varèse's work contains much more concrete sounds than electronic. ""A group made up of wind instruments, percussion and piano alternate with the mutated sounds of factory noises and ship sirens and motors, coming from two loudspeakers.""[42]

At the German premiere of Déserts in Hamburg, which was conducted by Bruno Maderna, the tape controls were operated by Karlheinz Stockhausen.[42] The title Déserts suggested to Varèse not only ""all physical deserts (of sand, sea, snow, of outer space, of empty streets), but also the deserts in the mind of man; not only those stripped aspects of nature that suggest bareness, aloofness, timelessness, but also that remote inner space no telescope can reach, where man is alone, a world of mystery and essential loneliness.""[43]

In Cologne, what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world, was officially opened at the radio studios of the NWDR in 1953, though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951.[44] The brainchild of Werner Meyer-Eppler, Robert Beyer, and Herbert Eimert (who became its first director), the studio was soon joined by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In his 1949 thesis Elektronische Klangerzeugung: Elektronische Musik und Synthetische Sprache, Meyer-Eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals; in this way, elektronische Musik was sharply differentiated from French musique concrète, which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources.[45][46]

In 1953, Stockhausen composed his Studie I, followed in 1954 by Elektronische Studie II—the first electronic piece to be published as a score. In 1955, more experimental and electronic studios began to appear. Notable were the creation of the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano, a studio at the NHK in Tokyo founded by Toshiro Mayuzumi, and the Philips studio at Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which moved to the University of Utrecht as the Institute of Sonology in 1960.

""With Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel in residence, [Cologne] became a year-round hive of charismatic avante-gardism.""[47] on two occasions combining electronically generated sounds with relatively conventional orchestras—in Mixtur (1964) and Hymnen, dritte Region mit Orchester (1967).[48] Stockhausen stated that his listeners had told him his electronic music gave them an experience of ""outer space"", sensations of flying, or being in a ""fantastic dream world"".[49]

In the United States, electronic music was being created as early as 1939, when John Cage published Imaginary Landscape, No. 1, using two variable-speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano, and cymbal, but no electronic means of production. Cage composed five more ""Imaginary Landscapes"" between 1942 and 1952 (one withdrawn), mostly for percussion ensemble, though No. 4 is for twelve radios and No. 5, written in 1952, uses 42 recordings and is to be realized as a magnetic tape. According to Otto Luening, Cage also performed Williams Mix at Donaueschingen in 1954, using eight loudspeakers, three years after his alleged collaboration.[clarification needed]Williams Mix was a success at the Donaueschingen Festival, where it made a ""strong impression"".[50]

The Music for Magnetic Tape Project was formed by members of the New York School (John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, David Tudor, and Morton Feldman),[51] and lasted three years until 1954. Cage wrote of this collaboration: ""In this social darkness, therefore, the work of Earle Brown, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff continues to present a brilliant light, for the reason that at the several points of notation, performance, and audition, action is provocative.""[52]

Cage completed Williams Mix in 1953 while working with the Music for Magnetic Tape Project.[53] The group had no permanent facility, and had to rely on borrowed time in commercial sound studios, including the studio of Bebe and Louis Barron.

In the same year Columbia University purchased its first tape recorder—a professional Ampex machine—to record concerts. Vladimir Ussachevsky, who was on the music faculty of Columbia University, was placed in charge of the device, and almost immediately began experimenting with it.

Herbert Russcol writes: ""Soon he was intrigued with the new sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another.""[54] Ussachevsky said later: ""I suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated as an instrument of sound transformation.""[54] On Thursday, 8 May 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition, and Underwater Valse. In an interview, he stated: ""I presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in New York together with other compositions I had written for conventional instruments.""[54]
Otto Luening, who had attended this concert, remarked: ""The equipment at his disposal consisted of an Ampex tape recorder . . . and a simple box-like device designed by the brilliant young engineer, Peter Mauzey, to create feedback, a form of mechanical reverberation. Other equipment was borrowed or purchased with personal funds.""[55]

Just three months later, in August 1952, Ussachevsky traveled to Bennington, Vermont, at Luening's invitation to present his experiments. There, the two collaborated on various pieces. Luening described the event: ""Equipped with earphones and a flute, I began developing my first tape-recorder composition. Both of us were fluent improvisors and the medium fired our imaginations.""[55] They played some early pieces informally at a party, where ""a number of composers almost solemnly congratulated us saying, 'This is it' ('it' meaning the music of the future).""[55]

Word quickly reached New York City. Oliver Daniel telephoned and invited the pair to ""produce a group of short compositions for the October concert sponsored by the American Composers Alliance and Broadcast Music, Inc., under the direction of Leopold Stokowski at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After some hesitation, we agreed. . . . Henry Cowell placed his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, at our disposal. With the borrowed equipment in the back of Ussachevsky's car, we left Bennington for Woodstock and stayed two weeks. . . . In late September 1952, the travelling laboratory reached Ussachevsky's living room in New York, where we eventually completed the compositions.""[55]

Two months later, on 28 October, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening presented the first Tape Music concert in the United States. The concert included Luening's Fantasy in Space (1952)—""an impressionistic virtuoso piece""[55] using manipulated recordings of flute—and Low Speed (1952), an ""exotic composition that took the flute far below its natural range.""[55] Both pieces were created at the home of Henry Cowell in Woodstock, New York. After several concerts caused a sensation in New York City, Ussachevsky and Luening were invited onto a live broadcast of NBC's Today Show to do an interview demonstration—the first televised electroacoustic performance. Luening described the event: ""I improvised some [flute] sequences for the tape recorder. Ussachevsky then and there put them through electronic transformations.""[56]

The score for Forbidden Planet, by Louis and Bebe Barron,[57] was entirely composed using custom-built electronic circuits and tape recorders in 1956 (but no synthesizers in the modern sense of the word).[clarification needed]

In 1929, Nikolai Obukhov invented the ""sounding cross"" (la croix sonore), comparable to the principle of the theremin.[58] In the 1930s, Nikolai Ananyev invented ""sonar"", and engineer Alexander Gurov — neoviolena, I. Ilsarov — ilston.,[59]A. Rimsky-Korsakov [ru] and A. Ivanov — emiriton [ru].[58] Composer and inventor Arseny Avraamov was engaged in scientific work on sound synthesis and conducted a number of experiments that would later form the basis of Soviet electro-musical instruments.[60]

In 1956 Vyacheslav Mescherin created the Ensemble of electro-musical instruments [ru], which used theremins, electric harps, electric organs, the first synthesizer in the USSR ""Ekvodin"",[58] and also created the first Soviet reverb machine. The style in which Meshcherin's ensemble played is known as ""Space age pop"".[60] In 1957, engineer Igor Simonov assembled a working model of a noise recorder (electroeoliphone), with the help of which it was possible to extract various timbres and consonances of a noise nature.[58] In 1958, Evgeny Murzin designed ANS synthesizer, one of the world's first polyphonic musical synthesizers.

Founded by Murzin in 1966, the Moscow Experimental Electronic Music Studio became the base for a new generation of experimenters – Eduard Artemyev, Alexander Nemtin [ru], Sándor Kallós, Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, and Vladimir Martynov.[58][60] By the end of the 1960s, musical groups playing light electronic music appeared in the USSR. At the state level, this music began to be used to attract foreign tourists to the country and for broadcasting to foreign countries.[61] In the mid-1970s, composer Alexander Zatsepin designed an ""orchestrolla"" – a modification of the mellotron.[62]

The Baltic Soviet Republics also had their own pioneers: in Estonian SSR — Sven Grunberg, in Lithuanian SSR — Gedrus Kupriavicius, in Latvian SSR — Opus and Zodiac.[60]

The world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist, only the accurate reconstruction.[63] However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951.[64] The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.

The earliest group of electronic musical instruments in Japan, Yamaha Magna Organ was built in 1935.[65] however, after World War II, Japanese composers such as Minao Shibata knew of the development of electronic musical instruments. By the late 1940s, Japanese composers began experimenting with electronic music and institutional sponsorship enabled them to experiment with advanced equipment. Their infusion of Asian music into the emerging genre would eventually support Japan's popularity in the development of music technology several decades later.[66]

Following the foundation of electronics company Sony in 1946, composers Toru Takemitsu and Minao Shibata independently explored possible uses for electronic technology to produce music.[67] Takemitsu had ideas similar to musique concrète, which he was unaware of, while Shibata foresaw the development of synthesizers and predicted a drastic change in music.[68] Sony began producing popular magnetic tape recorders for government and public use.[66][69]

The avant-garde collective Jikken Kōbō (Experimental Workshop), founded in 1950, was offered access to emerging audio technology by Sony. The company hired Toru Takemitsu to demonstrate their tape recorders with compositions and performances of electronic tape music.[70] The first electronic tape pieces by the group were ""Toraware no Onna"" (""Imprisoned Woman"") and ""Piece B"", composed in 1951 by Kuniharu Akiyama.[71] Many of the electroacoustic tape pieces they produced were used as incidental music for radio, film, and theatre. They also held concerts employing a slide show synchronized with a recorded soundtrack.[72] Composers outside of the Jikken Kōbō, such as Yasushi Akutagawa, Saburo Tominaga, and Shirō Fukai, were also experimenting with radiophonic tape music between 1952 and 1953.[69]

Musique concrète was introduced to Japan by Toshiro Mayuzumi, who was influenced by a Pierre Schaeffer concert. From 1952, he composed tape music pieces for a comedy film, a radio broadcast, and a radio drama.[71][73] However, Schaeffer's concept of sound object was not influential among Japanese composers, who were mainly interested in overcoming the restrictions of human performance.[74] This led to several Japanese electroacoustic musicians making use of serialism and twelve-tone techniques,[74] evident in Yoshirō Irino's 1951 dodecaphonic piece ""Concerto da
Camera"",[73] in the organization of electronic sounds in Mayuzumi's ""X, Y, Z for Musique Concrète"", and later in Shibata's electronic music by 1956.[75]

Modelling the NWDR studio in Cologne, established an NHK electronic music studio  in Tokyo in 1954, which became one of the world's leading electronic music facilities.The NHK electronic music studio  was equipped with technologies such as tone-generating and audio processing equipment, recording and radiophonic equipment, ondes Martenot, Monochord and Melochord, sine-wave oscillators, tape recorders, ring modulators, band-pass filters, and four- and eight-channel mixers. Musicians associated with the studio included Toshiro Mayuzumi, Minao Shibata, Joji Yuasa, Toshi Ichiyanagi, and Toru Takemitsu. The studio's first electronic compositions were completed in 1955, including Mayuzumi's five-minute pieces ""Studie I: Music for Sine Wave by Proportion of Prime Number"", ""Music for Modulated Wave by Proportion of Prime Number"" and ""Invention for Square Wave and Sawtooth Wave"" produced using the studio's various tone-generating capabilities, and Shibata's 20-minute stereo piece ""Musique Concrète for Stereophonic Broadcast"".[76][77]

The impact of computers continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed Illiac Suite for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition. ""... Hiller postulated that a computer could be taught the rules of a particular style and then called on to compose accordingly.""[78] Later developments included the work of Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential MUSIC I program in 1957, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music. Vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed Gesang der Jünglinge, the first major work of the Cologne studio, based on a text from the Book of Daniel. An important technological development of that year was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer by Raymond Scott with subassembly by Robert Moog.

In 1957, Kid Baltan (Dick Raaymakers) and Tom Dissevelt released their debut album, Song Of The Second Moon, recorded at the Philips studio in the Netherlands.[79] The public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Varèse's Poème électronique, which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 Brussels World Fair. That same year, Mauricio Kagel, an Argentine composer, composed Transición II. The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on the piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.

In 1958, Columbia-Princeton developed the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, the first programmable synthesizer.[80] Prominent composers such as Vladimir Ussachevsky, Otto Luening, Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen, Halim El-Dabh, Bülent Arel and Mario Davidovsky used the RCA Synthesizer extensively in various compositions.[81] One of the most influential composers associated with the early years of the studio was Egypt's Halim El-Dabh who,[82] after having developed the earliest known electronic tape music in 1944,[34] became more famous for Leiyla and the Poet, a 1959 series of electronic compositions that stood out for its immersion and seamless fusion of electronic and folk music, in contrast to the more mathematical approach used by serial composers of the time such as Babbitt. El-Dabh's Leiyla and the Poet, released as part of the album Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in 1961, would be cited as a strong influence by a number of musicians, ranging from Neil Rolnick, Charles Amirkhanian and Alice Shields to rock musicians Frank Zappa and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band.[83]

Following the emergence of differences within the GRMC (Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète) Pierre Henry, Philippe Arthuys, and several of their colleagues, resigned in April 1958. Schaeffer created a new collective, called Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) and set about recruiting new members including Luc Ferrari, Beatriz Ferreyra, François-Bernard Mâche, Iannis Xenakis, Bernard Parmegiani, and Mireille Chamass-Kyrou. Later arrivals included Ivo Malec, Philippe Carson, Romuald Vandelle, Edgardo Canton and François Bayle.[84]

These were fertile years for electronic music—not just for academia, but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed the composition of Luening's Gargoyles for violin and tape as well as the premiere of Stockhausen's Kontakte for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versions—one for 4-channel tape, and the other for tape with human performers. ""In Kontakte, Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax. This new approach, which he termed 'moment form', resembles the 'cinematic splice' techniques in early twentieth-century film.""[85]

The theremin had been in use since the 1920s but it attained a degree of popular recognition through its use in science-fiction film soundtrack music in the 1950s (e.g., Bernard Herrmann's classic score for The Day the Earth Stood Still).[86]

In the UK in this period, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (established in 1958) came to prominence, thanks in large measure to their work on the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who. One of the most influential British electronic artists in this period[87] was Workshop staffer Delia Derbyshire, who is now famous for her 1963 electronic realisation of the iconic Doctor Who theme, composed by Ron Grainer.

During the time of the UNESCO fellowship for studies in electronic music (1958) Josef Tal went on a study tour in the US and Canada.[88] He summarized his conclusions in two articles that he submitted to UNESCO.[89] In 1961, he established the Centre for Electronic Music in Israel at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1962, Hugh Le Caine arrived in Jerusalem to install his Creative Tape Recorder in the centre.[90] In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr. Shlomo Markel, in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and the Volkswagen Foundation a research project ('Talmark') aimed at the development of a novel musical notation system for electronic music.[91]

Milton Babbitt composed his first electronic work using the synthesizer—his Composition for Synthesizer (1961)—which he created using the RCA synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

For Babbitt, the RCA synthesizer was a dream come true for three reasons. First, the ability to pinpoint and control every musical element precisely. Second, the time needed to realize his elaborate serial structures were brought within practical reach. Third, the question was no longer ""What are the limits of the human performer?"" but rather ""What are the limits of human hearing?""[92]

The collaborations also occurred across oceans and continents. In 1961, Ussachevsky invited Varèse to the Columbia-Princeton Studio (CPEMC). Upon arrival, Varese embarked upon a revision of Déserts. He was assisted by Mario Davidovsky and Bülent Arel.[93]

The intense activity occurring at CPEMC and elsewhere inspired the establishment of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1963 by Morton Subotnick, with additional members Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, Anthony Martin, and Terry Riley.[94]

Later, the Center moved to Mills College, directed by Pauline Oliveros, and has since been renamed Center for Contemporary Music.[95]Pietro Grossi was an Italian pioneer of computer composition and tape music, who first experimented with electronic techniques in the early sixties. Grossi was a cellist and composer, born in Venice in 1917. He founded the S 2F M (Studio de Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) in 1963 to experiment with electronic sound and composition.

Simultaneously in San Francisco, composer Stan Shaff and equipment designer Doug McEachern, presented the first ""Audium"" concert at San Francisco State College (1962), followed by work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1963), conceived of as in time, controlled movement of sound in space. Twelve speakers surrounded the audience, four speakers were mounted on a rotating, mobile-like construction above.[96] In an SFMOMA performance the following year (1964), San Francisco Chronicle music critic Alfred Frankenstein commented, ""the possibilities of the space-sound continuum have seldom been so extensively explored"".[96] In 1967, the first Audium, a ""sound-space continuum"" opened, holding weekly performances through 1970. In 1975, enabled by seed money from the National Endowment for the Arts, a new Audium opened, designed floor to ceiling for spatial sound composition and performance.[97] ""In contrast, there are composers who manipulated sound space by locating multiple speakers at various locations in a performance space and then switching or panning the sound between the sources. In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation is dependent on the location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese's Poeme Electronique (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stan Schaff's Audium installation, currently active in San Francisco.""[98][99] Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff ""sculpts"" sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.[100]

Jean-Jacques Perrey experimented with Schaeffer's techniques on tape loops and was among the first to use the recently released Moog synthesizer developed by Robert Moog. With this instrument he composed some works with Gershon Kingsley and solo.[101] A well-known example of the use of Moog's full-sized Moog modular synthesizer is the 1968 Switched-On Bach album by Wendy Carlos, which triggered a craze for synthesizer music.[102] In 1969 David Tudor brought a Moog modular synthesizer and Ampex tape machines to the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad with the support of the Sarabhai family, forming the foundation of India's first electronic music studio. Here a group of composers Jinraj Joshipura, Gita Sarabhai, SC Sharma, IS Mathur and Atul Desai developed experimental sound compositions between 1969 and 1973.[103]

Musical melodies were first generated by the computer CSIRAC in Australia in 1950. There were newspaper reports from America and England (early and recently) that computers may have played music earlier, but thorough research has debunked these stories as there is no evidence to support the newspaper reports (some of which were obviously speculative). Research has shown that people speculated about computers playing music, possibly because computers would make noises,[104] but there is no evidence that they actually did it.[105][106]

The world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard in the 1950s. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the ""Colonel Bogey March""[107] of which no known recordings exist.
However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice.

The first music to be performed in England was a performance of the British National Anthem that was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Ferranti Mark I, late in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the National Anthem, ""Ba, Ba Black Sheep"", and ""In the Mood"" and this is recognised as the earliest recording of a computer to play music. This recording can be heard at this Manchester University site. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch declicked and restored this recording in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.[108][109][64]

The late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s also saw the development of large mainframe computer synthesis. Starting in 1957, Max Mathews of Bell Labs developed the MUSIC programs, culminating in MUSIC V, a direct digital synthesis language.[110]Laurie Spiegel developed the algorithmic musical composition software ""Music Mouse"" (1986) for Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari computers.

An important new development was the advent of computers to compose music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. Iannis Xenakis began what is called musique stochastique, or stochastic music, which is a composing method that uses mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used computers to compose pieces like ST/4 for string quartet and ST/48 for orchestra (both 1962),[111]Morsima-Amorsima, ST/10, and Atrées. He developed the computer system UPIC for translating graphical images into musical results and composed Mycènes Alpha (1978) with it.

In Europe in 1964, Karlheinz Stockhausen composed Mikrophonie I for tam-tam, hand-held microphones, filters, and potentiometers, and Mixtur for orchestra, four sine-wave generators, and four ring modulators. In 1965 he composed Mikrophonie II for choir, Hammond organ, and ring modulators.[112]

In 1966–1967, Reed Ghazala discovered and began to teach ""circuit bending""—the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by John Cage's aleatoric music  [sic] concept.[113]

Cosey Fanni Tutti's performance art and musical career explored the concept of 'acceptable' music and she went on to explore the use of sound as a means of desire or discomfort.[114][failed verification]

Wendy Carlos performed selections from her album Switched-On Bach on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra; another live performance was with Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for ""Bach at the Beacon"" in 1997.[115] In June 2018, Suzanne Ciani released LIVE Quadraphonic, a live album documenting her first solo performance on a Buchla synthesizer in 40 years. It was one of the first quadraphonic vinyl releases in over 30 years.[116]

In the 1950s,[117][118] Japanese electronic musical instruments began influencing the international music industry.[119][120]Ikutaro Kakehashi, who founded Ace Tone in 1960, developed his own version of electronic percussion that had been already popular on the overseas electronic organ.[121] At the 1964 NAMM Show, he revealed it as the R-1 Rhythm Ace, a hand-operated percussion device that played electronic drum sounds manually as the user pushed buttons, in a similar fashion to modern electronic drum pads.[121][122][123]

In 1963, Korg released the Donca-Matic DA-20, an electro-mechanical drum machine.[124] In 1965, Nippon Columbia patented a fully electronic drum machine.[125] Korg released the Donca-Matic DC-11 electronic drum machine in 1966, which they followed with the Korg Mini Pops, which was developed as an option for the Yamaha Electone electric organ.[124] Korg's Stageman and Mini Pops series were notable for ""natural metallic percussion"" sounds and incorporating controls for drum ""breaks and fill-ins.""[120]

In 1967, Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi patented a preset rhythm-pattern generator using diode matrix circuit[126] similar to the Seeburg's prior U.S. patent 3,358,068 filed in 1964 (See Drum machine#History), which he released as the FR-1 Rhythm Ace drum machine the same year.[121] It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred.[121] Ace Tone's Rhythm Ace drum machines found their way into popular music from the late 1960s, followed by Korg drum machines in the 1970s.[120] Kakehashi later left Ace Tone and founded Roland Corporation in 1972, with Roland synthesizers and drum machines becoming highly influential for the next several decades.[121] The company would go on to have a big impact on popular music, and do more to shape popular electronic music than any other company.[123]

Turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspin or scratching.[127] The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic),[128] based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.[129] In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10,[129] the first direct-drive turntable on the market,[130] and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.[129] It was succeeded by the Technics SL-1100 and SL-1200 in the early 1970s, and they were widely adopted by hip hop musicians,[129] with the SL-1200 remaining the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for several decades.[131]

In Jamaica, a form of popular electronic music emerged in the 1960s, dub music, rooted in sound system culture. Dub music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, King Tubby, Errol Thompson, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, and Scientist, producing reggae-influenced experimental music with electronic sound technology, in recording studios and at sound system parties.[132] Their experiments included forms of tape-based composition comparable to aspects of musique concrète, an emphasis on repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements) comparable to minimalism, the electronic manipulation of spatiality, the sonic electronic manipulation of pre-recorded musical materials from mass media, deejays toasting over pre-recorded music comparable to live electronic music,[132]remixing music,[133]turntablism,[134] and the mixing and scratching of vinyl.[135]

Despite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge.[133] King Tubby, for example, was a sound system proprietor and electronics technician, whose small front-room studio in the Waterhouse ghetto of western Kingston was a key site of dub music creation.[136]

In the late 1960s, pop and rock musicians, including the Beach Boys and the Beatles, began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound. The first bands to utilize the Moog synthesizer would be the Doors on Strange Days[137] as well as the Monkees on Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. In his book Electronic and Experimental Music, Thom Holmes recognises the Beatles' 1966 recording ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" as the song that ""ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music"" due to the band's incorporation of tape loops and reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds.[138]

Also in the late 1960s, the music duos Silver Apples, Beaver and Krause, and experimental rock bands like White Noise, the United States of America, Fifty Foot Hose, and Gong are regarded as pioneers in the electronic rock and electronica genres for their work in melding psychedelic rock with oscillators and synthesizers.[139][140][141][142][143][144] The 1969 instrumental ""Popcorn"" written by Gershon Kingsley for Music To Moog By became a worldwide success due to the 1972 version made by Hot Butter.[145][146]

The Moog synthesizer was brought to the mainstream in 1968 by Switched-On Bach, a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by American composer Wendy Carlos. The album achieved critical and commercial success, winning the 1970 Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording.

In 1969, David Borden formed the world's first synthesizer ensemble called the Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company in Ithaca, New York.[147]

By the end of the 1960s, the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock with bands including Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Genesis making them part of their sound. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Can, Neu!, and Faust to circumvent the language barrier.[148] Their synthesiser-heavy ""krautrock"", along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock.[149]

Ambient dub was pioneered by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists, using DJ-inspired ambient electronics, complete with drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It featured layering techniques and incorporated elements of world music, deep basslines and harmonic sounds.[150] Techniques such as a long echo delay were also used.[151] Other notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Orb, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground.[152]

Dub music influenced electronic musical techniques later adopted by hip hop music when Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc in the early 1970s introduced Jamaica's sound system culture and dub music techniques to America. One such technique that became popular in hip hop culture was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation, extending the b-dancers' favorite section.[153] The turntable eventually went on to become the most visible electronic musical instrument, and occasionally the most virtuosic, in the 1980s and 1990s.[134]

Electronic rock was also produced by several Japanese musicians, including Isao Tomita's Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock (1972), which featured Moog synthesizer renditions of contemporary pop and rock songs,[154] and Osamu Kitajima's progressive rock album Benzaiten (1974).[155] The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Tomita and Klaus Schulze who were significant influences on the development of new-age music.[150] The hi-tech appeal of these works created for some years the trend of listing the electronic musical equipment employed in the album sleeves, as a distinctive feature. Electronic music began to enter regularly in radio programming and top-sellers charts, as the French band Space with their debut studio album Magic Fly[156] or Jarre with Oxygène.[157] Between 1977 and 1981, Kraftwerk released albums such as Trans-Europe Express, The Man-Machine or Computer World, which influenced subgenres of electronic music.[158]

In this era, the sound of rock musicians like Mike Oldfield and The Alan Parsons Project (who is credited the first rock song to feature a digital vocoder in 1975, The Raven) used to be arranged and blended with electronic effects and/or music as well, which became much more prominent in the mid-1980s. Jeff Wayne achieved a long-lasting success[159] with his 1978 electronic rock musical version of The War of the Worlds.

Film scores also benefit from the electronic sound. During the 1970s and 1980s, Wendy Carlos composed the score for A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Tron.[160] In 1977, Gene Page recorded a disco version of the hit theme by John Williams from Steven Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Page's version peaked on the R&B chart at #30.[citation needed] The score of 1978 film Midnight Express composed by Italian synth-pioneer Giorgio Moroder won the Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1979, as did it again in 1981 the score by Vangelis for Chariots of Fire.[161] After the arrival of punk rock, a form of basic electronic rock emerged, increasingly using new digital technology to replace other instruments. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the punk scene in New York, utilized drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and punk on their eponymous 1977 album.[162]

Synth-pop pioneering bands which enjoyed success for years included Ultravox with their 1977 track ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" on Ha!-Ha!-Ha!,[163]Yellow Magic Orchestra with their self-titled album (1978), The Buggles with their prominent 1979 debut single Video Killed the Radio Star,[164]Gary Numan with his solo debut album The Pleasure Principle and single Cars in 1979,[165]Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark with their 1979 single Electricity featured on their eponymous debut album, Depeche Mode with their first single Dreaming of Me recorded in 1980 and released in 1981 album Speak & Spell,[166]A Flock of Seagulls with their 1981 single Talking,[167]New Order with Ceremony[168] in 1981, and The Human League with their 1981 hit Don't You Want Me from their third album Dare.[169]

The definition of MIDI and the development of digital audio made the development of purely electronic sounds much easier,[170] with audio engineers, producers and composers exploring frequently the possibilities of virtually every new model of electronic sound equipment launched by manufacturers. Synth-pop sometimes used synthesizers to replace all other instruments, but it was more common that bands had one or more keyboardists in their line-ups along with guitarists, bassists, and/or drummers. These developments led to the growth of synth-pop, which after it was adopted by the New Romantic movement, allowed synthesizers to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 1980s until the style began to fall from popularity in the mid-to-end of the decade.[169] Along with the aforementioned successful pioneers, key acts included Yazoo, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Talk Talk, Japan, and Eurythmics.

Synth-pop was taken up across the world, with international hits for acts including Men Without Hats, Trans-X and Lime from Canada, Telex from Belgium, Peter Schilling, Sandra, Modern Talking, Propaganda and Alphaville from Germany, Yello from Switzerland and Azul y Negro from Spain. Also, the synth sound is a key feature of Italo-disco.

Some synth-pop bands created futuristic visual styles of themselves to reinforce the idea of electronic sounds were linked primarily with technology, as Americans Devo and Spaniards Aviador Dro.

Keyboard synthesizers became so common that even heavy metal rock bands, a genre often regarded as the opposite in aesthetics, sound and lifestyle from that of electronic pop artists by fans of both sides, achieved worldwide success with themes as 1983 Jump[171] by Van Halen and 1986 The Final Countdown[172] by Europe, which feature synths prominently.

Elektronmusikstudion [sv] (EMS), formerly known as Electroacoustic Music in Sweden, is the Swedish national centre for electronic music and sound art. The research organisation started in 1964 and is based in Stockholm.

STEIM is a center for research and development of new musical instruments in the electronic performing arts, located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. STEIM has existed since 1969. It was founded by Misha Mengelberg, Louis Andriessen, Peter Schat, Dick Raaymakers, Jan van Vlijmen [nl], Reinbert de Leeuw, and Konrad Boehmer. This group of Dutch composers had fought for the reformation of Amsterdam's feudal music structures; they insisted on Bruno Maderna's appointment as musical director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and enforced the first public fundings for experimental and improvised electronic music in the Netherlands.

IRCAM in Paris became a major center for computer music research and realization and development of the Sogitec 4X computer system,[173] featuring then revolutionary real-time digital signal processing. Pierre Boulez's Répons (1981) for 24 musicians and 6 soloists used the 4X to transform and route soloists to a loudspeaker system.

Barry Vercoe describes one of his experiences with early computer sounds:

At IRCAM in Paris in 1982, flutist Larry Beauregard had connected his flute to DiGiugno's 4X audio processor, enabling real-time pitch-following. On a Guggenheim at the time, I extended this concept to real-time score-following with automatic synchronized accompaniment, and over the next two years Larry and I gave numerous demonstrations of the computer as a chamber musician, playing Handel flute sonatas, Boulez's Sonatine for flute and piano and by 1984 my own Synapse II for flute and computer—the first piece ever composed expressly for such a setup. A major challenge was finding the right software constructs to support highly sensitive and responsive accompaniment. All of this was pre-MIDI, but the results were impressive even though heavy doses of tempo rubato would continually surprise my Synthetic Performer. In 1985 we solved the tempo rubato problem by incorporating learning from rehearsals (each time you played this way the machine would get better). We were also now tracking violin, since our brilliant, young flautist had contracted a fatal cancer. Moreover, this version used a new standard called MIDI, and here I was ably assisted by former student Miller Puckette, whose initial concepts for this task he later expanded into a program called MAX.[175]

Released in 1970 by Moog Music, the Mini-Moog was among the first widely available, portable, and relatively affordable synthesizers. It became once the most widely used synthesizer at that time in both popular and electronic art music.[176]Patrick Gleeson, playing live with Herbie Hancock at the beginning of the 1970s, pioneered the use of synthesizers in a touring context, where they were subject to stresses the early machines were not designed for.[177][178]

In 1974, the WDR studio in Cologne acquired an EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer, which many composers used to produce notable electronic works—including Rolf Gehlhaar's Fünf deutsche Tänze (1975), Karlheinz Stockhausen's Sirius (1975–1976), and John McGuire's Pulse Music III (1978).[179]

Thanks to miniaturization of electronics in the 1970s, by the start of the 1980s keyboard synthesizers, became lighter and affordable, integrating into a single slim unit all the necessary audio synthesis electronics and the piano-style keyboard itself, in sharp contrast with the bulky machinery and ""cable spaguetty"" employed along with the 1960s and 1970s. First, with analog synthesizers, the trend followed with digital synthesizers and samplers as well (see below).

In 1975, the Japanese company Yamaha licensed the algorithms for frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis) from John Chowning, who had experimented with it at Stanford University since 1971.[180][181] Yamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm for use in a digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the ""key scaling"" method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation.[182]

In 1980, Yamaha eventually released the first FM digital synthesizer, the Yamaha GS-1, but at an expensive price.[183] In 1983, Yamaha introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the DX7, which also used FM synthesis and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time.[180] The DX7 was known for its recognizable bright tonalities that was partly due to an overachieving sampling rate of 57 kHz.[184]

The Korg Poly-800 is a synthesizer released by Korg in 1983. Its initial list price of $795 made it the first fully programmable synthesizer that sold for less than $1000. It had 8-voice polyphony with one Digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) per voice.

The Casio CZ-101 was the first and best-selling phase distortion synthesizer in the Casio CZ line. Released in November 1984, it was one of the first (if not the first) fully programmable polyphonic synthesizers that was available for under $500.

The Roland D-50 is a digital synthesizer produced by Roland and released in April 1987. Its features include subtractive synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987–1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds.

A sampler is an electronic or digital musical instrument which uses sound recordings (or ""samples"") of real instrument sounds (e.g., a piano, violin or trumpet), excerpts from recorded songs (e.g., a five-second bass guitar riff from a funk song) or found sounds (e.g., sirens and ocean waves). The samples are loaded or recorded by the user or by a manufacturer. These sounds are then played back using the sampler program itself, a MIDI keyboard, sequencer or another triggering device (e.g., electronic drums) to perform or compose music. Because these samples are usually stored in digital memory, the information can be quickly accessed. A single sample may often be pitch-shifted to different pitches to produce musical scales and chords.

Before computer memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron was the most notable model, used by many groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical.

The earliest digital sampling was done on the EMS Musys system, developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing), and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio c. 1969.

The first commercially available sampling synthesizer was the Computer Music Melodian by Harry Mendell (1976).

First released in 1977–1978,[185] the Synclavier I using FM synthesis, re-licensed from Yamaha,[186] and sold mostly to universities, proved to be highly influential among both electronic music composers and music producers, including Mike Thorne, an early adopter from the commercial world, due to its versatility, its cutting-edge technology, and distinctive sounds.

The first polyphonic digital sampling synthesizer was the Australian-produced Fairlight CMI, first available in 1979. These early sampling synthesizers used wavetable sample-based synthesis.[187]

In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, Roland—and later, other participants that included Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai.[188] A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

Miller Puckette developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called Max (after Max Mathews) and later ported it to Macintosh (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for Opcode)[189] for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

The early 1980s saw the rise of bass synthesizers, the most influential being the Roland TB-303, a bass synthesizer and sequencer released in late 1981 that later became a fixture in electronic dance music,[190] particularly acid house.[191] One of the first to use it was Charanjit Singh in 1982, though it would not be popularized until Phuture's ""Acid Tracks"" in 1987.[191]Music sequencers began being used around the mid 20th century, and Tomita's albums in mid-1970s being later examples.[154] In 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra were using computer-based technology in conjunction with a synthesiser to produce popular music,[192] making their early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer.[193][194][failed verification]

Drum machines, also known as rhythm machines, also began being used around the late-1950s, with a later example being Osamu Kitajima's progressive rock album Benzaiten (1974), which used a rhythm machine along with electronic drums and a synthesizer.[155] In 1977, Ultravox's ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" was one of the first singles to use the metronome-like percussion of a Roland TR-77 drum machine.[163] In 1980, Roland Corporation released the TR-808, one of the first and most popular programmable drum machines. The first band to use it was Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1980, and it would later gain widespread popularity with the release of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" and Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock"" in 1982.[195] The TR-808 was a fundamental tool in the later Detroit techno scene of the late 1980s, and was the drum machine of choice for Derrick May and Juan Atkins.[196]

The characteristic lo-fi sound of chip music was initially the result of early computer's sound chips and sound cards' technical limitations; however, the sound has since become sought after in its own right.

Common cheap popular sound chips of the first home computers of the 1980s include the SID of the Commodore 64 and General Instrument AY series and clones (like the Yamaha YM2149) used in the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX compatibles and Atari ST models, among others.

Synth-pop continued into the late 1980s, with a format that moved closer to dance music, including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and The Communards, achieving success along much of the 1990s.

The trend has continued to the present day with modern nightclubs worldwide regularly playing electronic dance music (EDM). Today, electronic dance music has radio stations,[197] websites,[198] and publications like Mixmag dedicated solely to the genre. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro, and trance, as well as their respective subgenres.[199][200][201] Moreover, the genre has found commercial and cultural significance in the United States and North America, thanks to the wildly popular big room house/EDM sound that has been incorporated into the U.S. pop music[202] and the rise of large-scale commercial raves such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival.

On the other hand, a broad group of electronic-based music styles intended for listening rather than strictly for dancing became known under the ""electronica"" umbrella[203][204] which was also a music scene in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom.[204] According to a 1997 Billboard article, ""the union of the club community and independent labels"" provided the experimental and trend-setting environment in which electronica acts developed and eventually reached the mainstream, citing American labels such as Astralwerks (the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, the Future Sound of London, Fluke), Moonshine (DJ Keoki), Sims, Daft Punk and City of Angels (the Crystal Method) for popularizing the latest version of electronic music.[citation needed]

The category ""indie electronic"" (or ""indietronica"")[205] has been used to refer to a wave of groups with roots in independent rock who embraced electronic elements (such as synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and computer programs) and influences such as early electronic composition, krautrock, synth-pop, and dance music.[206] Recordings are commonly made on laptops using digital audio workstations.[205]

The first wave of indie electronic artists began in the 1990s with acts such as Stereolab (who used vintage gear) and Disco Inferno (who embraced modern sampling technology), and the genre expanded in the 2000s as home recording and software synthesizers came into common use.[206] Other acts included Broadcast, Lali Puna, Múm, the Postal Service, Skeletons, and School of Seven Bells.[206] Independent labels associated with the style include Warp, Morr Music, Sub Pop, and Ghostly International.[206]

As computer technology has become more accessible and music software has advanced, interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices:[207] for instance, laptop performance (laptronica),[208]live coding[209][210] and Algorave. In general, the term Live PA refers to any live performance of electronic music, whether with laptops, synthesizers, or other devices.

Beginning around the year 2000, some software-based virtual studio environments emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal.[211] Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, it is now possible to create high-quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances have democratized music creation,[212] leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet. Software-based instruments and effect units (so-called ""plugins"") can be incorporated in a computer-based studio using the VST platform. Some of these instruments are more or less exact replicas of existing hardware (such as the Roland D-50, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha DX7, or Korg M1).[citation needed]

Circuit bending is the modification of battery-powered toys and synthesizers to create new unintended sound effects. It was pioneered by Reed Ghazala in the 1960s and Reed coined the name ""circuit bending"" in 1992.[213]

Following the circuit bending culture, musicians also began to build their own modular synthesizers, causing a renewed interest in the early 1960s designs. Eurorack became a popular system."
"Azonto","Azonto is a dance and music genre from Ghana.[1]Ghana News Agency cites their  study which found out the dance is connected to the traditional Ga dance Kpanlogo, associated with the coastal towns in the country such as Chorkor, James Town, Teshie, Nungua and Tema, in the Greater Accra Region.[2]

Several accounts say Azonto was formerly known as 'Apaa' in these communities.[3] The Apaa dance, hence Azonto dance, involves a set of hand movements that either mimic everyday activities especially ones concerning people's livelihoods,[4] or moves that are meant to amuse an audience.

It began with one- or two-step movements but has been advanced to more complex and almost acrobatic movements.[5] Just like most African dances, Azonto involves knee bending and hip movements. The dance has effectively evolved from a few basic moves to miming actions such as ironing of clothes, washing, driving, boxing, praying, swimming, and others.[6]

Azonto is a communicative dance believed to originate from ""Apaa"" which literally means to work. Apaa was used to show the profession of an individual. The azonto dance has since grown further to relay coded messages. The dance later got into the minds of most Ghanaians. In the same year (2013),[7] most Ghanaian music videos were full of Azonto dance and later spread to most African countries and other parts of the world.[8][9]

Azonto[1] is identified with Ghanaian indigeneity by those abroad and with cosmopolitanism by those at home""[10]

Azonto can be traced as far back as one of R2Bees upcoming songs ""Azonto"" but was rejuvenated by Guru's Lapaz Toyota and later the producer NshonnaMusick with the song ""You Go Kill Me"" which had Sarkodie (rapper) and EL (rapper) on it. It was later  popularized on social media by the music videos that portrayed the dance form with fast-pace tempos, home-made dance instructional videos uploaded on YouTube with no commercial intent, and group choreographers done by mostly Ghanaians and other African nationals living in UK, Germany and U.S.[11]"
"Funk carioca","

Funk carioca ([ˈfɐ̃k(i) ˌkɐɾiˈɔkɐ]), also known as favela funk, in other parts of the world as baile funk and Brazilian funk, or even simply funk, is a hip hop-influenced music genre from Rio de Janeiro, blending the rap subgenres of Miami bass and gangsta rap.[1][2] Despite its name, funk carioca has no musical correlation with the American funk by any means.[3]

In Brazil, ""baile funk"" refers not to the music, but to the actual parties or discotheques in which the music is played (.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbajli], from baile, meaning ""ball"").[4] Although originated in Rio, ""funk carioca"" has become increasingly popular among working classes in other parts of Brazil. In the whole country, funk carioca is most often simply known as ""funk"", although it is very musically different from what with ""funk music"" is internationally meant.[5] In fact, it still shows its urban afro beat influences.

Funk carioca was once a direct derivative of samba, Miami bass, Latin music, traditional African religious music, candomble, hip-hop and freestyle (another Miami-based genre) music from the US. The reason why these genres, very localized in the US, became popular and influential in Rio de Janeiro is due to proximity. Miami was a popular plane stop for Rio DJs to buy the latest American records. Along with the Miami influence came the longtime influence of the slave trade in Colonial Brazil. Various African religions like vodun, and candomble were brought with the enslaved Africans to the Americas. The same beat is found in Afro-religious music in the African diaspora and many black Brazilians identify as being part of this religion. This genre of music was mainly started by those in black communities in Brazil, therefore a boiling pot of influences to derive the hall-mark.

Many similar types of music genres can be found in Caribbean island nations such as; Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Barbados, Haiti, Puerto Rico, among others. Bounce music, which originates from New Orleans, Louisiana, also has a similar beat. New Orleans, originally a French territory, was a hub for Atlantic slave trade before it was sold to the United States. All of these areas with similar music genres retain the influence of American hip hop, African music and Latin music.[6]

During the 1970s, nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro played funk and soul music.[3] One of the bands that was formed in this period was Soul Grand Prix.[7]

Funk carioca was popularized in the 1980s in Rio de Janeiro's favelas, the city's predominantly Afro-Brazilian slums. From the mid-1990s on, it was a mainstream phenomenon in Brazil. Funk songs discuss topics as varied as poverty, human dignity, racial pride of black people, sex, violence, and social injustice. Social analysts believe that funk carioca is a genuine expression of the severe social issues that burden the poor and black people in Rio.

According to DJ Marlboro, the main influence for the emergence of funk carioca was the single ""Planet Rock"" by Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force, released in 1982.[8]

Carioca in its early days were mostly loops of electronic drums from Miami bass or freestyle records and the 4–6 beat afrobeat tempo, while a few artists composed them with actual drum machines. The most common drum beat was a loop of DJ Battery Brain's ""808 volt"", commonly referred to as ""Voltmix"", though Hassan's ""Pump Up the Party"" is also notable.[9][10][11] Nowadays, carioca funk rhythms are mostly based on tamborzão rhythms instead of the older drum machine loops.

Melodies are usually sampled. Older songs typically chopped up freestyle samples for the melody, or had none at all. Modern funk uses a set of samples from various sources, notably horn and accordion stabs, as well as the horn intro to the ""Rocky"" theme. Funk carioca has always used a small catalog of rhythms and samples that almost all songs take from (commonly with several in the same song). Funk carioca songs can either be instrumental or include rapping, singing, or something in between the two. Popularized by Brazilians and other Afro-Latino people, the saying ""Bum-Cha-Cha, Bum Cha-Cha"" , ""Bum-Cha-Cha, Cha Cha"" or even ""Boom-Pop-Pop, Pop,Pop"" is a representation of the beat that comes along in most funk songs.
[1][12]

Funk carioca is different from the funk originated in the US. Starting in 1970, styles like bailes da pesada, black soul, shaft, and funk started to emerge in Rio de Janeiro. As time went on, DJs started to look for other rhythms of black music, but the original name did not remain. Funk carioca first emerged and is played throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, but not only in the city of Rio, like Rio natives like to believe. Funk carioca is mostly appealing to the youth. In the decade of the 1980s, anthropologist Herman Vianna was the first social scientist to take funk as an object to study in his masters thesis, which gave origin to the book O Mundo Funk carioca, which translates to The Carioca Funk World (1988). During that decade, funk dances lost a bit of popularity due to the emergence of disco music, a pop version of soul and funk, especially after the release of the film Saturday Night Fever (1977) starring John Travolta and with its soundtrack of the band Bee Gees. At the time, the then teenager Fernando Luís Mattos da Matta was interested in the discotheque when listening to the program Cidade Disco Club on Radio City of Rio de Janeiro (102.9 FM). Years later, Fernando would adopt the nickname of DJ Marlboro and the radio would be known as the Rio ""rock radio"".

The term baile funk is used to refer to the parties in which funk carioca is played. The history of these parties were important in shaping the Brazilian funk scene, and in fact predate the genre itself. In the late '60s, legendary Brazilian DJ and radio personality Big Boy (born Newton Alvarenga Duarte) was on a personal mission to introduce Brazil to the best sounds from around the globe.

Collecting records covering genres such as pop, rock, jazz, and soul from all over the world, he gained popularity on air for his wide taste of music, as well as the relaxed way of presenting his programs.[13] His success on air also attracted large audiences for parties he DJ'd in the Zona Sul area of Rio, which like his show, featured a wide array of different music. His sound mainly featured elements of rock, psych, and soul music, and many described the tunes he played as 'heavy'. At the same time, Ademir Lemos had been hosting his own block parties centering more around soul and funk, both of which had a growing audience in Brazil. The two eventually came to host parties together, infusing the heavy sounding records from Big Boy's (primarily) rock background with Lemos' funkier influences. Thus formed the Baile da Pesada, or ""Heavy Dance"", which brought (North American) funk music to the forefront of Rio's street scene as the city entered the 70's.[14]

For almost two decades afterwards, other DJs from the streets of Rio would use evolving forms of African-American and American music in their own block parties, put together by equipes de som (sound teams). Soul music became the immediate focus of the parties, and quickly ushered in a new wave of Brazilian soul artists to the mainstream. Soon, the soul movement was overshadowed by disco, but disco music was not easily embraced by many of the DJs hosting the bailes. Many of these DJs bought records from the US, particularly Miami given its closer proximity to Brazil. The DJs took a liking to various forms of hip-hop, most notably Miami bass and electro/freestyle, which changed the style of the bailes once again.[15] Still, the term funk remained in Rio's party scene. DJs would incorporate local sound with Miami bass beats, including their own lyrics in Portuguese. DJ Marlboro was the pioneer of this phenomenon, and was the first to engineer the sound that would become known in Rio as funk carioca.[16][17]

There are a number of subgenres derived from funk carioca.

Brega funk born in Recife, influenced by brega in the early 2010s in the Northeast region of Brazil. Unlike funk carioca, brega funk has a glossy sound that features glistening syncopated MIDI pianos, synths, often filtered guitars, and the distinct pitched metallic snares called caixas, vocal chops are a common companion to the wonky kick rhythm and up-down bass inherited from brega, and even though the genre commonly ranges from 160 to 180 BPM, the half-time beat makes it feel slower than other funk subgenres. An example of the Brega funk genre is the song ""Parabéns"" by Pabllo Vittar.[18][19]

Funk melody is based on electro rhythms but with a romantic lyrical approach.[20] It has been noted for being powered by female artists. Among the popular funk melody singers are Anitta, Perlla, Babi and Copacabana Beat.

Funk ostentação is a sub-genre of Rio de Janeiro funk created in São Paulo in 2008. The lyrical and thematic content of songs in this style focuses mainly on conspicuous consumption, as well as a focus on materialistic activities, glorification of style of urban life and ambitions to leave the favela. Since then, funk ostentação has been strongly associated with the emerging  nova classe média  (new middle class) in Brazil.[21]

Proibidão is a derivative of funk carioca related to prohibited practices. The content of the genre involves the sale of illegal drugs and the war against police agencies, as well as the glorification and praise of the drug cartels, similar to gangsta rap.

Rasteirinha or Raggafunk[22] is a slower style of Rio de Janeiro funk that rests around 96 BPM and uses atabaques, tambourines and beatboxing. It also incorporates influences from reggaeton and axé. ""Fuleragem"" by MC WM is the best known songs of the Rasteirinha genre.[23]

Rave funk is a mix of funk carioca and electronic music, created in 2016 by DJ GBR.[24] Among rave funk's most popular songs is ""É Rave Que Fala Né"" by Kevinho.

In 2018, the Funk carioca of 150 beats per minute or 150 BPM was created by DJs Polyvox and Rennan da Penha.[25][26] In 2019, the funk carioca 150 BPM was adopted by carnival blocks.[27] ""Ela É Do Tipo"", by Kevin O Chris, is one of the most popular songs of the genre.[28]

Funk mandelão, also known as Ritmo dos Fluxos, is a subgenre that emerged in São Paulo in the late 2010s, inspired by the Baile do Mandela, a popular party in Praia Grande. The term “mandelão” comes from “Mandela”, a reference to the South African leader Nelson Mandela. Mandelão is characterized by having simple and repetitive lyrics. The musical production is minimalist and raw, with heavy beats and blown basses, that create a catchy and danceable rhythm. Some of the instruments used in mandelão are the piano, synthesizer, sampler and the computer. Funk mandelão is also marked by having its own choreography, which consists of fast and synchronized movements of the arms and legs.[29]

An example of the success of Mandelão was the song “Automotivo Bibi Fogosa”, sung by the Brazilian artist Bibi Babydoll, which reached the top of Spotify music charts in Ukraine in 2023 and reached #3 on both Belarus and Kazakhstan. It spread throughout the rest of Europe,[30] mainly in former Soviet Union states.

Brazilian Phonk is a subgenre that combines elements of funk carioca and phonk, creating a distinct and aggressive sound, with lyrics that address topics such as violence, drugs, sex and ostentation. The term “Brazilian phonk” was popularized by the Norwegian producer William Rød, better known as Slowboy.[31]

Fusion of funk carioca with pagode,[32][33][34] the term also refers to parties where both genres are played,[35] the origins of the subgenre can be traced back to the mid 90s, in 1997, the duo Claudinho & Buchecha released the song Fuzuê on the album A Forma, the song uses a cavaquinho, an instrument present in genres such as samba, choro and pagode, in the lyrics, the duo pays tribute to pagode artists.[36] Grupo Raça was successful with ""Ela sambou, eu dancei"", written by Arlindo Cruz, A. Marques and Geraldão,[37] which alluded to funk carioca. In 2014, the song was reinterpreted with elements of carioca funk with Arlindo Cruz himself with Mr. Catra.[38]

Mc Leozinho, made use of the cavaquinho in the song Sente a pegada from 2008.[39] Artists such as MC Delano and Ludmilla also use the cavaquinho in some songs,[39] in 2015, Ludimilla also participated in a duet with the band Molejo in Polivalência from the album of the same name released in 2000, in 2020, she released Numanice, an EP dedicated to the pagode.[40][41]

Until the year 2000, funk carioca was only a regional phenomenon. Then the European media began to report its peculiar combination of music, social issues with a strong sexual appeal (often pornographic).

In 2001, for the first time, funk carioca tracks appeared on a non-Brazilian label. One example is the album Favela Chic, released by BMG. It contained three old-school funk carioca hits, including the song ""Popozuda Rock n' Roll"" by De Falla.[42]

In 2003, the tune Quem Que Caguetou (Follow Me Follow Me) by Black Alien & Speed,[43] which was not a big hit in Brazil, was then used in a sports car commercial in Europe, and it helped increase the popularity of funk carioca. Brazilian duo Tetine compiled and mixed the compilation Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca, released by British label Mr Bongo Records featuring funk artists such as Deize Tigrona, Taty Quebra Barraco, Bonde do Tigrão amongst others. From 2002 Bruno Verner and Eliete Mejorado also broadcast Funk Carioca and interviewed artists in their radio show Slum Dunk on Resonance Fm. Berlin music journalist and DJ Daniel Haaksman released the seminal CD-compilations Rio Baile Funk Favela Booty Beats in 2004 and More Favela Booty Beats in 2006 through Essay Recordings.[44] He launched the international career of Popozuda Rock n´Roll artist Edu K,[45] whose baile funk anthem was used in a soft drink commercial in Germany. Haaksman continued to produce and distribute many new baile funk records, especially the EP series ""Funk Mundial""[46] and ""Baile Funk Masters"" on his label Man Recordings.

In 2004, dance clubs from Eastern Europe, mainly Romania and Bulgaria, increased the popularity of funk carioca due to the strong sexual appeal of the music and dance, also known as Bonde das Popozudas. Many funk carioca artists started to do shows abroad at that time. DJ Marlboro and Favela Chic Paris club were the pioneer travelers and producers. The funk carioca production was until then limited to playing in the ghettos and the Brazilian pop market. DJ Marlboro,[47] a major composer of funk carioca's tunes declared in 2006 in the Brazilian Isto É magazine how astonished he was with the sudden overseas interest in the genre. He would go on to travel in over 10 European countries.

In London, duo Tetine assembled a compilation album called Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca, which was released by Mr Bongo Records in 2004. Tetine also ran the weekly radio show Slum Dunk on London's radio art station Resonance Fm 104.4. Their radio show was entirely dedicated to funk carioca and worked as a platform for the duo to produce and organize a series of film programmes as well as interviews and gigs involving funk carioca artists from Rio. Tetine were also responsible for the first screening of the post-feminist documentary Eu Sou Feia Mas Tô Na Moda by filmmaker Denise Garcia which was co-produced by Tetine in London, and first shown in the city at the Slum Dunk Film Program at Brady Arts Centre in Bricklane in March 2005. Apart from this, Tetine also produced two albums with experimental DIY queer funk carioca tracks: Bonde do Tetão, released by Brazilian label Bizarre Records in 2004, and L.I.C.K My Favela, released by Kute Bash Records in 2005. Tetine also recorded with Deize Tigrona the track ""I Go to the Doctor"", included in the LP L.I.C.K My Favela in 2005 and later on their album Let Your X's Be Y's, released by Soul Jazz Records in 2008.

In Italy, Irma Records released the 2005 compilation Colors Music #4: Rio Funk. Many small labels (notably European label Arcade Mode and American labels Flamin´Hotz and Nossa) labels released several compilations and EPs in bootleg formats.

The artist MIA brought mainstream international popularity to funk carioca with her single Bucky Done Gun released in 2005,[citation needed] and brought attention to American DJ Diplo, who had worked on M.I.A.'s 2004 mixtape Piracy Funds Terrorism on the tracks Baile Funk One, Baile Funk Two, and Baile Funk Three.[48]Diplo made a bootleg mixtape, Favela on Blastin, in 2004[49] after Ivanna Bergese shared with him some compiled remix mixtapes of her performance act Yours Truly. He also produced documentary Favela on Blast, which was released in July 2010 and documents the role, culture, and character of funk carioca in Rio's favelas.[49]

Other indie video-documentaries have been made in Europe, especially in Germany and Sweden. These generally focused on the social issues in the favelas. One of the most famous of these series of documentaries is Mr Catra the faithful[50] (2005) by Danish filmmaker Andreas Rosforth Johnsen, broadcast by many European open and cable television channels.

London-based artist Sandra D'Angelo was the first Italian singer-producer to bring funk carioca to Italy.[citation needed] She performed in London with MC Gringo at Notting Hill Arts Club in 2008. She performed her baile funk productions for the contest Edison Change the Music in 2008. Sandra D'Angelo performed Baile Funk also in New York and produced tracks with EDU KA (Man Recordings) and DJ Amazing Clay from Rio.

In 2008, Berlin label Man Recordings released Gringão, the debut album by German MC Gringo — the only non-Brazilian MC performing in the bailes of Rio de Janeiro.

English indie pop band Everything Everything claim the drum patterns used on their Top 40 single Cough Cough were inspired by those used on Major Lazer's Pon de Floor, a funk carioca song.

In Brazil, funk carioca lyrics are often criticized due to their violent and sexually explicit lyrics. Girls are called ""cachorras"" (bitches) and ""popozudas"" – women with large buttocks, and many songs revolve around sex. ""Novinhas"" (young/pubescent girls) are also a frequent theme in funk carioca songs. Some of these songs, however, are sung by women.

The extreme banalization of sex and the incitement of promiscuity is viewed as a negative aspect of the funk carioca culture. Besides the moral considerations, in favelas, where sanitary conditions are poor and sex education low, this might lead to public health and social issues. In such communities, definitive contraceptive methods are hardly available and due to lack of education and awareness, family planning is close to nonexistent. This environment results in unwanted pregnancies, population overgrowth, and eventually the growth of the communities (favelização).[51][52]

The glamorization of criminality in the favelas is also frequently viewed as another negative consequence of funk carioca. Some funk songs, belonging to a style known as ""proibidão"" (""the forbidden""), have very violent lyrics and are sometimes composed by drug-dealing gangs. Its themes include praising the murders of rival gang members and cops, intimidating opposers, claiming power over the favelas, robbery, drug use and the illicit life of drug dealers in general. Authorities view some of these lyrics as ""recruiting"" people to organized crime and inciting violence, and playing some of these songs are thus considered a crime.[53]

Due to the lack of regulation and the locations where they usually take place, ""bailes funk"" are also very crime prone environments. They are popular hot spots for drug trade and consumption, dealers display power frequenting the parties heavily armed,[54] and even murder rates are high.[55]

More popular funk carioca artists usually compose two different sets of similar lyrics for their songs: one gentler, more ""appropriate"" version, and another with a harsher, cruder set of lyrics (not unlike the concept of ""clean"" and ""explicit"" versions of songs). The first version is the one broadcast by local radio stations; the second is played in dance halls, parties, and in public by sound cars.[56] Recurrent lyric topics in funk carioca are explicit sexual positions, the funk party, the police force, and the life of slum dwellers in the favelas.[57] Another large part of the lyrics is the use of the world around them – mainly the poverty that has enveloped the area. This is usually denounced in the lyrics and the hope for a better life is carried through many of their messages.[12]"
"Funk","

Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African-Americans in the mid-20th century. It deemphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a percussionist, often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a ""hypnotic"" and ""danceable"" feel.[3] It uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, and dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.

Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure (""The One""), and the application of swung 16th notes  and syncopation on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs.[4] Rock- and psychedelia-influenced musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s.[5] Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including Kool and the Gang,[6]Ohio Players, Fatback Band, Jimmy Castor Bunch, Earth, Wind & Fire, B.T. Express, Shalamar,[7] One Way, Lakeside, Dazz Band, The Gap Band, Slave, Aurra, Roger Troutman & Zapp, Con Funk Shun, Cameo, Bar-Kays and Chic.

Funk derivatives include avant-funk, an avant-garde strain of funk; boogie, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal; G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and psychedelic funk; Timba, a form of funky Cuban dance music; and funk jam. It is also the main influence of Washington go-go, a funk subgenre.[8] Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and electronic dance music.

The word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin ""fumigare"" (which means ""to smoke"") via Old French ""fungiere"" and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784, ""funky"" meaning ""musty"" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of ""earthy"" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something ""deeply or strongly felt"".[9][10] Even though in white culture, the term ""funk"" can have negative connotations of odor or being in a bad mood (""in a funk""), in African communities, the term ""funk"", while still linked to body odor, had the positive sense that a musician's hard-working, honest effort led to sweat, and from their ""physical exertion"" came an ""exquisite"" and ""superlative"" performance.[11]

In early jam sessions, musicians would encourage one another to ""get down"" by telling one another, ""Now, put some stank on it!"" At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as Funky. The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden, remembered as either ""Funky Butt"" or ""Buddy Bolden's Blues"", with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either ""comical and light"" or ""crude and downright obscene"" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.[12][13] As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when ""funk"" and ""funky"" were used increasingly in the context of jazz music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer ""was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.""[14] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians.[15] The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable.[citation needed]

The meaning of ""funk"" continues to captivate the genre of black music, feeling, and knowledge. Recent scholarship in black studies has taken the term ""funk"" in its many iterations to consider the range of black movement and culture. In particular, L.H. Stallings's Funk the Erotic: Transaesthetics and Black Sexual Cultures explores these multiple meanings of ""funk"" as a way to theorize sexuality, culture, and western hegemony within the many locations of ""funk"": ""street parties, drama/theater, strippers and strip clubs, pornography, and self-published fiction.""[16]

Like soul, funk is based on dance music, so it has a strong ""rhythmic role"".[17] The sound of funk is as much based on the ""spaces between the notes"" as the notes that are played; as such, rests between notes are important.[18] While there are rhythmic similarities between funk and disco, funk has a ""central dance beat that's slower, sexier and more syncopated than disco"", and funk rhythm section musicians add more ""subtextures"", complexity and ""personality"" onto the main beat than a programmed synth-based disco ensemble.[19]

Before funk, most pop music was based on sequences of eighth notes, because the fast tempos made further subdivisions of the beat infeasible.[3] The innovation of funk was that by using slower tempos (surely influenced by the revival of blues at early 60s), funk ""created space for further rhythmic subdivision, so a bar of 4/4 could now accommodate possible 16  note  placements.""[3]  Specifically, by having the guitar and drums play in ""motoring"" sixteenth-note rhythms, it created the opportunity for the other instruments to play ""more syncopated, broken-up style"", which facilitated a move to more ""liberated"" basslines. Together, these ""interlocking parts"" created a ""hypnotic"" and ""danceable feel"".[3]

A great deal of funk is rhythmically based on a two-celled onbeat/offbeat structure, which originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.[20] New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.[21]

Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. Some examples of chords used in funk are minor eleventh chords (e.g., F minor 11th); dominant seventh with added sharp ninth and a suspended fourth (e.g., C7 (#9) sus 4); dominant ninth chords (e.g., F9); and minor sixth chords (e.g., C minor 6).[18] The six-ninth chord is used in funk (e.g., F 6/9); it is a major chord with an added sixth and ninth.[18] In funk, minor seventh chords are more common than minor triads because minor triads were found to be too thin-sounding.[22] Some of the best known and most skillful soloists in funk have jazz backgrounds. Trombonist Fred Wesley and saxophonists Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, having worked with James Brown, George Clinton and Prince.

Unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord vamps (often alternating a minor seventh chord and a related dominant seventh chord, such as A minor to D7) with melodo-harmonic movement and a complex, driving rhythmic feel. Even though some funk songs are mainly one-chord vamps, the rhythm section musicians may embellish this chord by moving it up or down a semitone or a tone to create chromatic passing chords. For example, ""Play That Funky Music"" (by Wild Cherry) mainly uses an E ninth chord, but it also uses F#9 and F9.[23]

The chords used in funk songs typically imply a Dorian or Mixolydian mode, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the blues scale. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new subgenre of jazz-funk, which can be heard in recordings by Miles Davis (Live-Evil, On the Corner), and Herbie Hancock (Head Hunters).

Funk continues the African musical tradition of improvisation, in that in a funk band, the group would typically ""feel"" when to change, by ""jamming"" and ""grooving"", even in the studio recording stage, which might only be based on the skeleton framework for each song.[24] Funk uses ""collective improvisation"", in which musicians at rehearsals would have what was metaphorically a musical ""conversation"", an approach which extended to the onstage performances.[25]

Funk creates an intense groove by using strong guitar riffs and basslines played on electric bass. Like Motown recordings, funk songs use basslines as the centerpiece of songs. Indeed, funk has been called the style in which the bassline is most prominent in the songs,[26] with the bass playing the ""hook"" of the song.[27] Early funk basslines used syncopation (typically syncopated eighth notes), but with the addition of more of a ""driving feel"" than in New Orleans funk, and they used blues scale notes along with the major third above the root.[28] Later funk basslines use sixteenth note syncopation, blues scales, and repetitive patterns, often with leaps of an octave or a larger interval.[27]

Funk basslines emphasize repetitive patterns, locked-in grooves, continuous playing, and slap and popping bass. Slapping and popping uses a mixture of thumb-slapped low notes (also called ""thumped"") and finger ""popped"" (or plucked) high notes, allowing the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk. Notable slap and funky players include Bernard Edwards (Chic), Robert ""Kool"" Bell, Mark Adams (Slave), Johnny Flippin (Fatback)[29] and Bootsy Collins.[30] While slap and funky is important, some influential bassists who play funk, such as Rocco Prestia (from Tower of Power), did not use the approach, and instead used a typical fingerstyle method based on James Jamerson's Motown playing style.[30]Larry Graham from Sly and the Family Stone is an influential bassist.[31]

Funk bass has an ""earthy, percussive kind of feel"", in part due to the use of muted, rhythmic ghost notes[31] (also called ""dead notes"").[30] Some funk bass players use electronic effects units to alter the tone of their instrument, such as ""envelope filters"" (an auto-wah effect that creates a ""gooey, slurpy, quacky, and syrupy"" sound)[32] and imitate keyboard synthesizer bass tones[33] (e.g., the Mutron envelope filter)[27] and overdriven fuzz bass effects, which are used to create the ""classic fuzz tone that sounds like old school Funk records"".[34] Other effects that are used include the flanger and bass chorus.[27] Collins also used a Mu-Tron Octave Divider, an octave pedal that, like the Octavia pedal popularized by Hendrix, can double a note an octave above and below to create a ""futuristic and fat low-end sound"".[35]

Funk drumming creates a groove by emphasizing the drummer's ""feel and emotion"", which including ""occasional tempo fluctuations"", the use of swing feel in some songs (e.g., ""Cissy Strut"" by The Meters and ""I'll Take You There"" by The Staple Singers, which have a half-swung feel), and less use of fills (as they can lessen the groove).[36] Drum fills are ""few and economical"", to ensure that the drumming stays ""in the pocket"", with a steady tempo and groove.[37] These playing techniques are supplemented by a set-up for the drum kit that often includes muffled bass drums and toms and tightly tuned snare drums.[36]Double bass drumming sounds are often done by funk drummers with a single pedal, an approach which ""accents the second note... [and] deadens the drumhead's resonance"", which gives a short, muffled bass drum sound.[36]

James Brown used two drummers such as Clyde Stubblefield and John 'Jabo' Starks in recording and soul shows.[38] By using two drummers, the JB band was able to maintain a ""solid syncopated"" rhythmic sound, which contributed to the band's distinctive ""Funky Drummer"" rhythm.[38]

In Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi's playing, there are many ghost notes and rim shots.[36] A key part of the funk drumming style is using the hi-hat, with opening and closing the hi-hats during playing (to create ""splash"" accent effects) being an important approach.[39] Two-handed sixteenth notes on the hi-hats, sometimes with a degree of swing feel, is used in funk.[36]

Jim Payne states that funk drumming uses a ""wide-open"" approach to improvisation around rhythmic ideas from Latin music, ostinatos, that are repeated ""with only slight variations"", an approach which he says causes the ""mesmerizing"" nature of funk.[40] Payne states that funk can be thought of as ""rock played in a more syncopated manner"", particularly with the bass drum, which plays syncopated eighth-note and sixteenth-note patterns that were innovated by drummer Clive Williams (with Joe Tex); George Brown (with Kool & the Gang) and James ""Diamond"" Williams (with The Ohio Players).[41] As with rock, the snare provides backbeats in most funk (albeit with additional soft ghost notes).[40]

In funk, guitarists often mix playing chords of a short duration (nicknamed ""stabs"") with faster rhythms and riffs.[17] Guitarists playing rhythmic parts often play sixteenth notes, including with percussive ghost notes.[17] Chord extensions are favored, such as ninth chords.[17] Typically, funk uses ""two interlocking [electric] guitar parts"", with a rhythm guitarist and a ""tenor guitarist"" who plays single notes. The two guitarists trade off their lines to create a ""call-and-response, intertwined pocket.""[42] If a band only has one guitarist, this effect may be recreated by overdubbing in the studio, or, in a live show, by having a single guitarist play both parts, to the degree that this is possible.[42]

In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, using a style of picking called the ""chank"" or ""chicken scratch"",  in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the fingerboard and then quickly released just enough to get a muted ""scratching"" sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the bridge.[43] Earliest examples of that technic used on rhythm and blues is listened on Johnny Otis song ""Willie and the Hand Jive"" in 1957, with the future James Brown band guitar player Jimmy Nolen. The technique can be broken down into three approaches: the ""chika"", the ""chank"" and the ""choke"". With the ""chika"" comes a muted sound of strings being hit against the fingerboard; ""chank"" is a staccato attack done by releasing the chord with the fretting hand after strumming it; and ""choking"" generally uses all the strings being strummed and heavily muted.[18]

The result of these factors was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the electric bass and the cutting tone of the snare and hi-hats, with a rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep in the pocket. Guitarist Jimmy Nolen, longtime guitarist for James Brown, developed this technique. On Brown's ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose"" (1969), however, Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used. Nolen created a ""clean, trebly tone"" by using ""hollow-body jazz guitars with single-coil P-90 pickups"" plugged into a Fender Twin Reverb amp with the mid turned down low and the treble turned up high.[44]

Funk guitarists playing rhythm guitar generally avoid distortion effects and amp overdrive to get a clean sound, and given the importance of a crisp, high sound, Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters were widely used for their cutting treble tone.[44] The mids are often cut by guitarists to help the guitar sound different from the horn section, keyboards and other instruments.[44] Given the focus on providing a rhythmic groove, and the lack of emphasis on instrumental guitar melodies and guitar solos, sustain is not sought out by funk rhythm guitarists.[44] Funk rhythm guitarists use compressor volume-control effects to enhance the sound of muted notes, which boosts the ""clucking"" sound and adds ""percussive excitement to funk rhythms"" (an approach used by Nile Rodgers).[45]

Guitarist Eddie Hazel from Funkadelic is notable for his solo improvisation (particularly for the solo on ""Maggot Brain"") and guitar riffs, the tone of which was shaped by a Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone pedal.[35] Hazel, along with guitarist Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers, was influenced by Jimi Hendrix's improvised, wah-wah infused solos. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Hendrix, when Hendrix was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the Isleys' household. Funk guitarists use the wah-wah sound effect along with muting the notes to create a percussive sound for their guitar riffs. The phaser effect is often used in funk and R&B guitar playing for its filter sweeping sound effect, an example being the Isley Brothers' song ""Who's That Lady"".[46]Michael Hampton, another P-Funk guitarist, was able to play Hazel's virtuosic solo on ""Maggot Brain"", using a solo approach that added in string bends and Hendrix-style feedback.[35]

A range of keyboard instruments are used in funk. Acoustic piano is used in funk, including in ""September"" by Earth Wind & Fire and ""Will It Go Round in Circles"" by Billy Preston. The electric piano is used on songs such as Herbie Hancock's ""Chameleon"" (a Fender Rhodes) and ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" by Joe Zawinul (a Wurlitzer). The clavinet is used for its percussive tone, and it can be heard in songs such as Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" and ""Higher Ground"" and Bill Withers' ""Use Me"". The Hammond B-3 organ is used in funk, in songs such as ""Cissy Strut"" by The Meters and ""Love the One You're With"" (with Aretha Franklin singing and Billy Preston on keyboards).

Bernie Worrell's range of keyboards from his recordings with Parliament Funkadelic demonstrate the wide range of keyboards used in funk, as they include the Hammond organ (""Funky Woman"", ""Hit It and Quit It"", ""Wars of Armageddon""); RMI electric piano (""I Wanna Know If It's Good to You?"", ""Free Your Mind"", ""Loose Booty""); acoustic piano (""Funky Dollar Bill"", ""Jimmy's Got a Little Bit of Bitch in Him""); clavinet (""Joyful Process"", ""Up for the Down Stroke"", ""Red Hot Mama""); Minimoog synthesizer (""Atmosphere"", ""Flash Light"", ""Aqua Boogie"", ""Knee Deep"", ""Let's Take It to the Stage""); and ARP string ensemble synth (""Chocolate City"", ""Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)"", ""Undisco Kidd"").

Synthesizers were used in funk both to add to the deep sound of the electric bass, or even to replace the electric bass altogether in some songs.[47] Funk synthesizer bass, most often a Minimoog, was used because it could create layered sounds and new electronic tones that were not feasible on electric bass.[47]

In the 1970s, funk used many of the same vocal styles that were used in African-American music in the 1960s, including singing influences from blues, gospel, jazz and doo-wop.[38] Like these other African-American styles, funk used ""[y]ells, shouts, hollers, moans, humming, and melodic riffs"", along with styles such as call and response and narration of stories (like the African oral tradition approach).[48] The call and response in funk can be between the lead singer and the band members who act as backup vocalists.[49]

As funk emerged from soul, the vocals in funk share soul's approach; however, funk vocals tend to be ""more punctuated, energetic, rhythmically percussive[,] and less embellished"" with ornaments, and the vocal lines tend to resemble horn parts and have ""pushed"" rhythms.[50] Funk bands such as Earth, Wind & Fire have harmony vocal parts.[19] Songs like ""Super Bad"" by James Brown included ""double-voice"" along with ""yells, shouts and screams"".[51] Funk singers used a ""black aesthetic"" to perform that made use of ""colorful and lively exchange of gestures, facial expressions, body posture, and vocal phrases"" to create an engaging performance.[52]

The lyrics in funk music addressed issues faced by the African American community in the United States during the 1970s, which arose due to the move away from an industrial, working-class economy to an information economy, which harmed the Black working class.[53] Funk songs by The Ohio Players, Earth, Wind & Fire, and James Brown raised issues faced by lower-income Blacks in their song lyrics, such as poor ""economic conditions and themes of poor inner-city life in the black communities"".[54]

The Funkadelic song ""One Nation Under A Groove"" (1978) is about the challenges that Blacks overcame during the 1960s civil rights movement, and it includes an exhortation for Blacks in the 1970s to capitalize on the new ""social and political opportunities"" that had become available in the 1970s.[55] The Isley Brothers song ""Fight the Power"" (1975) has a political message.[56] Parliament's song ""Chocolate City"" (1975) metaphorically refers to Washington, D.C., and other US cities that have a mainly Black population, and it draws attention to the potential power that Black voters wield and suggests that a Black President be considered in the future.[57]

The political themes of funk songs and the aiming of the messages to a Black audience echoed the new image of Blacks that was created in Blaxploitation films, which depicted ""African-American men and women standing their ground and fighting for what was right"".[58] Both funk and Blaxploitation films addressed issues faced by Blacks and told stories from a Black perspective.[58] Another link between 1970s funk and Blaxploitation films is that many of these films used funk soundtracks (e.g., Curtis Mayfield for Superfly; James Brown and Fred Wesley for Black Caesar and War for Youngblood).[59]

Funk songs included metaphorical language that was understood best by listeners who were ""familiar with the black aesthetic and [black] vernacular"".[60] For example, funk songs included expressions such as ""shake your money maker"", ""funk yourself right out"" and ""move your boogie body"".[61] Another example is the use of ""bad"" in the song ""Super Bad"" (1970), which black listeners knew meant ""good"" or ""great"".[49]

In the 1970s, to get around radio obscenity restrictions, funk artists would use words that sounded like non-allowed words and double entendres to get around these restrictions.[62] For example, The Ohio Players had a song entitled ""Fopp"" which referred to ""Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong/We'll be foppin' all night long..."".[62] Some funk songs used made-up words which suggested that they were ""writing lyrics in a constant haze of marijuana smoke"", such as Parliament's ""Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)"", which includes words such as ""bioaquadooloop"".[62] The mainstream white listener base was often not able to understand funk's lyrical messages, which contributed to funk's lack of popular music chart success with white audiences during the 1970s.[63]

Horn section arrangements with groups of brass instruments are often used in funk songs.[19] Funk horn sections could include saxophone (often tenor sax), trumpet, trombone, and for larger horn sections, such as quintets and sextets, a baritone sax.[3] Horn sections played ""rhythmic and syncopated"" parts, often with ""offbeat phrases"" that emphasize ""rhythmic displacement"".[3] Funk song introductions are an important place for horn arrangements.[3]

Funk horn sections performed in a ""rhythmic percussive style"" that mimicked the approach used by funk rhythm guitarists.[64] Horn sections would ""punctuate"" the lyrics by playing in the spaces between vocals, using ""short staccato rhythmic blast[s]"".[64] Notable funk horn players included Alfred ""PeeWee"" Ellis, trombonist Fred Wesley, and alto sax player Maceo Parker.[64] Notable funk horn sections including the Phoenix Horns (with Earth, Wind & Fire), the Horny Horns (with Parliament), the Memphis Horns (with Isaac Hayes), and MFSB (with Curtis Mayfield).[64]

The instruments in funk horn sections varied. If there were two horn players, it could be trumpet and sax, trumpet and trombone, or two saxes.[3]  A standard horn trio would consist of trumpet, sax, and trombone, but trios of one trumpet with two saxes, or two trumpets with one sax, were also fairly common.[3] A quartet would be set up the same as a standard horn trio, but with an extra trumpet, sax, or (less frequently) trombone player. Quintets would either be a trio of saxes (typically alto/tenor/baritone, or tenor/tenor/baritone) with a trumpet and a trombone, or a pair each of trumpets and saxes with one trombone. With six instruments, the horn section would usually be two trumpets, three saxes, and a trombone.[3]

Notable songs with funk horn sections include:

In bands or shows where hiring a horn section is not feasible, a keyboardist can play the horn parts on a synthesizer with brass patches; however, choosing an authentic-sounding synthesizer and brass patch is important.[3] In the 2010s, with micro-MIDI synths, it may even have been possible to have another instrumentalist play the keyboard brass parts, thus enabling the keyboardist to continue to comp throughout the song.[3]

Funk bands in the 1970s adopted Afro-American fashion and style, including ""Bell-bottom pants, platform shoes, hoop earring[s], Afros [hairstyles], leather vests,... beaded necklaces"",[65]dashiki shirts, jumpsuits and boots.[66] In contrast to earlier bands such as The Temptations, which wore ""matching suits"" and ""neat haircuts"" to appeal to white mainstream audiences, funk bands adopted an ""African spirit"" in their outfits and style.[60]George Clinton and Parliament are known for their imaginative costumes and ""freedom of dress"", which included bedsheets acting as robes and capes.[67]

Funk was formed through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African Americans in the mid-20th century. Musicologist Anne Danielsen wrote that funk might be placed in the lineage of rhythm and blues, jazz, and soul.[68] Sociologist Darby E. Southgate wrote that funk is ""an amalgam of gospel, soul, jazz fusion, rhythm and blues, and black rock.""[1]

The distinctive characteristics of African-American musical expression are rooted in sub-Saharan African music traditions, and find their earliest expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel, blues, and ""body rhythms"" (hambone, patting juba, and ring shout clapping and stomping patterns).

Like other styles of African-American musical expression including jazz, soul music and R&B, funk music accompanied many protest movements during and after the Civil Rights Movement.

Gerhard Kubik notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a ""very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early twentieth century African-American music ... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African time lines.""[69]

In the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the two-celled time line structure was brought into New Orleans blues. New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to Afro-Cuban influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming.[70]Dave Bartholomew and Professor Longhair (Henry Roeland Byrd) incorporated Afro-Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as ""Carnival Day"" (Bartholomew 1949) and ""Mardi Gras In New Orleans"" (Longhair 1949). Robert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and ""fell under the spell of Perez Prado's mambo records.""[20] Professor Longhair's particular style was known locally as rumba-boogie.[21]

One of Longhair's great contributions was his particular approach of adopting two-celled, clave-based patterns into New Orleans rhythm and blues (R&B). Longhair's rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk. According to Dr. John (Malcolm John ""Mac"" Rebennack Jr.), the Professor ""put funk into music ... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.""[71] In his ""Mardi Gras in New Orleans"", the pianist employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba-boogie ""guajeo"".[72]

The syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Alexander Stewart states: ""Eventually, musicians from outside of New Orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices [of the Crescent City]. Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, and some of his most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. ""Please, Please, Please"" (1956), ""Bewildered"" (1961), ""I Don't Mind"" (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming.""[73] Stewart makes the point: ""The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.""[74]

James Brown credited Little Richard's 1950s R&B road band, The Upsetters from New Orleans, as ""the first to put the funk into the rhythm"" of rock and roll.[75] Following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957, some of Little Richard's band members joined Brown and the Famous Flames, beginning a long string of hits for them in 1958. By the mid-1960s, James Brown had developed his signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the backbeat that typified African-American music.[76] Brown often cued his band with the command ""On the one!,"" changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the one-two-three-four backbeat of traditional soul music to the one-two-three-four downbeat – but with an even-note syncopated guitar rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, repetitive brassy swing. This one-three beat launched the shift in Brown's signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, ""Out of Sight"" and his 1965 hits, ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"" and ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"".

Brown's style of funk was based on interlocking, contrapuntal parts: syncopated basslines, 16th beat drum patterns, and syncopated guitar riffs.[4] The main guitar ostinatos for ""Ain't it Funky"" (c. late 1960s) are an example of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk— an irresistibly danceable riff, stripped down to its rhythmic essence. On ""Ain't it Funky"" the tonal structure is barebones. Brown's innovations led to him and his band becoming the seminal funk act; they also pushed the funk music style further to the forefront with releases such as ""Cold Sweat"" (1967), ""Mother Popcorn"" (1969) and ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine"" (1970), discarding even the twelve-bar blues featured in his earlier music. Instead, Brown's music was overlaid with ""catchy, anthemic vocals"" based on ""extensive vamps"" in which he also used his voice as ""a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythm-section patterns ... [resembling] West African polyrhythms"" – a tradition evident in African-American work songs and chants.[77] Throughout his career, Brown's frenzied vocals, frequently punctuated with screams and grunts, channeled the ""ecstatic ambiance of the black church"" in a secular context.[77]

After 1965, Brown's bandleader and arranger was Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's adoption of New Orleans drumming techniques, as the basis of modern funk: ""If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – you got exactly what you wanted. And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming.""[78] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from ""New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s.""[74] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states that this model ""...is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.""[79]

In a 1990 interview, Brown offered his reason for switching the rhythm of his music: ""I changed from the upbeat to the downbeat ... Simple as that, really.""[80] According to Maceo Parker, Brown's former saxophonist, playing on the downbeat was at first hard for him and took some getting used to. Reflecting back to his early days with Brown's band, Parker reported that he had difficulty playing ""on the one"" during solo performances, since he was used to hearing and playing with the accent on the second beat.[81]

A new group of musicians began to further develop the ""funk rock"" approach.  Innovations were prominently made by George Clinton, with his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. Together, they produced a new kind of funk sound heavily influenced by jazz and psychedelic rock.  The two groups shared members and are often referred to collectively as ""Parliament-Funkadelic"". The breakout popularity of Parliament-Funkadelic gave rise to the term ""P-Funk"", which referred to the music by George Clinton's bands, and defined a new subgenre. Clinton played a principal role in several other bands, including Parlet, the Horny Horns, and the Brides of Funkenstein, all part of the P-Funk conglomerate. ""P-funk"" also came to mean something in its quintessence, of superior quality, or sui generis.

Following the work of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s, artists such as Sly and the Family Stone combined the psychedelic rock of Hendrix with funk, borrowing wah pedals, fuzz boxes, echo chambers, and vocal distorters from the former, as well as blues rock and jazz.[82] In the following years, groups such as Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work.[82]

Other musical groups picked up on the rhythms and vocal style developed by James Brown and his band, and the funk style began to grow. Dyke and the Blazers, based in Phoenix, Arizona, released ""Funky Broadway"" in 1967, perhaps the first record of the soul music era to have the word ""funky"" in the title. In 1969 Jimmy McGriff released Electric Funk, featuring his distinctive organ over a blazing horn section.  Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band was releasing funk tracks beginning with its first album in 1967, culminating in the classic single ""Express Yourself"" in 1971. Also from the West Coast area, more specifically Oakland, California, came the band Tower of Power (TOP), which formed in 1968. Their debut album, East Bay Grease, released 1970, is considered a milestone in funk. Throughout the 1970s, TOP had many hits, and the band helped to make funk music a successful genre, with a broader audience.

In 1970, Sly & the Family Stone's ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"" reached #1 on the charts, as did ""Family Affair"" in 1971.  Notably, these afforded the group and the genre crossover success and greater recognition, yet such success escaped comparatively talented and moderately popular funk band peers. The Meters defined funk in New Orleans, starting with their top ten R&B hits ""Sophisticated Cissy"" and ""Cissy Strut"" in 1969. Another group who defined funk around this time were the Isley Brothers, whose funky 1969 #1 R&B hit, ""It's Your Thing"", signaled a breakthrough in African-American music, bridging the gaps of the jazzy sounds of Brown, the psychedelic rock of Jimi Hendrix, and the upbeat soul of Sly & the Family Stone and Mother's Finest. The Temptations, who had previously helped to define the ""Motown Sound"" – a distinct blend of pop-soul – adopted this new psychedelic sound towards the end of the 1960s as well. Their producer, Norman Whitfield, became an innovator in the field of psychedelic soul, creating hits with a newer, funkier sound for many Motown acts, including ""War"" by Edwin Starr, ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" by the Undisputed Truth and ""Papa Was A Rollin' Stone"" by the Temptations. Motown producers Frank Wilson (""Keep On Truckin'"") and Hal Davis (""Dancing Machine"") followed suit. Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye also adopted funk beats for some of their biggest hits in the 1970s, such as ""Superstition"" and ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"", and ""I Want You"" and ""Got To Give It Up"", respectively.

The 1970s were the era of highest mainstream visibility for funk music. In addition to Parliament Funkadelic, artists like Sly and the Family Stone, Rufus & Chaka Khan, Bootsy's Rubber Band, the Isley Brothers, Ohio Players, Con Funk Shun, Kool and the Gang, the Bar-Kays, Commodores, Roy Ayers, Curtis Mayfield, and Stevie Wonder, among others, got radio play. Disco music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco music hits, such as all of Barry White's hits, ""Kung Fu Fighting"" by Biddu and Carl Douglas, Donna Summer's ""Love To Love You Baby"", Diana Ross' ""Love Hangover"", KC and the Sunshine Band's ""I'm Your Boogie Man"", ""I'm Every Woman"" by Chaka Khan (also known as the Queen of Funk), and Chic's ""Le Freak"" conspicuously include riffs and rhythms derived from funk.  In 1976, Rose Royce scored a number-one hit with a purely dance-funk record, ""Car Wash"". Even with the arrival of disco, funk became increasingly popular well into the early 1980s.

Funk music was also exported to Africa, and it melded with African singing and rhythms to form Afrobeat. Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, who was heavily influenced by James Brown's music, is credited with creating the style and terming it ""Afrobeat"".

Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds[83] and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers.  The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.[84] Jazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Similar genres include soul jazz and jazz fusion, but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production.

In the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the over-indulgence of disco, many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by electronic instruments, drum machines and synthesizers. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by synth keyboards, and the horns that remained were given simplified lines, and few horn solos were given to soloists. The classic electric keyboards of funk, like the Hammond B3 organ, the Hohner Clavinet and/or the Fender Rhodes piano, began to be replaced by the new digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 and microprocessor-controlled analog synthesizers like the Prophet-5 and Oberheim OB-X. Electronic drum machines such as the Roland TR-808, Linn LM-1, and Oberheim DMX began to replace the ""funky drummers"" of the past, and the slap and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth keyboard basslines. Lyrics of funk songs began to change from suggestive double entendres to more graphic and sexually explicit content.

Influenced by Kraftwerk, the Afroamerican rap DJ Afrika Bambaataa developed electro-funk, a minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single ""Planet Rock"" in 1982.[85] Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the TR-808 drum machine. The single ""Renegades of Funk"" followed in 1983.[85] Michael Jackson was also influenced by electro-funk.[86] In 1980, techno-funk music used the TR-808 programmable drum machine,[87] while Kraftwerk's sound influenced [88] later electro-funk artists such as Mantronix.[89]

Rick James was the first funk musician of the 1980s to assume the funk mantle dominated by P-Funk in the 1970s. His 1981 album Street Songs, with the singles ""Give It to Me Baby"" and ""Super Freak"", resulted in James becoming a star, and paved the way for the future direction of explicitness in funk.

Prince formed the Time, originally conceived as an opening act for him and based on his ""Minneapolis sound"", a hybrid mixture of funk, R&B, rock, pop and new wave. Eventually, the band went on to define their own style of stripped-down funk based on tight musicianship and sexual themes.

Similar to Prince, other bands emerged during the P-Funk era and began to incorporate uninhibited sexuality, dance-oriented themes, synthesizers and other electronic technologies to continue to craft funk hits. These included Cameo, Zapp, the Gap Band, the Bar-Kays, and the Dazz Band, who all found their biggest hits in the early 1980s. By the latter half of the 1980s, pure funk had lost its commercial impact; however, pop artists from Michael Jackson to Culture Club often used funk beats.

While funk was driven away from radio by slick commercial hip hop, contemporary R&B and new jack swing, its influence continued to spread. Artists like Steve Arrington and Cameo still received major airplay and had huge global followings.  Rock bands began adopting elements of funk into their sound, creating new combinations of ""funk rock"" and ""funk metal"". Extreme, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Living Colour, Jane's Addiction, Prince, Primus, Urban Dance Squad, Fishbone, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Infectious Grooves, and Incubus spread the approach and styles garnered from funk pioneers to new audiences in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s. These bands later inspired the underground mid-1990s funkcore movement and current funk-inspired artists like Outkast, Malina Moye, Van Hunt, and Gnarls Barkley.

In the 1990s, artists like Me'shell Ndegeocello, Brooklyn Funk Essentials and the (predominantly UK-based) acid jazz movement—including artists and bands such as Jamiroquai, Incognito, Galliano, Omar, Los Tetas and the Brand New Heavies—carried on with strong elements of funk. However, they never came close to reaching the commercial success of funk in its heyday—with the exception of Jamiroquai, whose album Travelling Without Moving sold about 11.5 million units worldwide and remains the best-selling funk album in history.[90] Meanwhile, in Australia and New Zealand, bands playing the pub circuit, such as Supergroove, Skunkhour and the Truth, preserved a more instrumental form of funk.

Since the late 1980s, hip hop artists have regularly sampled old funk tunes. James Brown is said to be the most sampled artist in the history of hip hop, while P-Funk is the second most sampled artist; samples of old Parliament and Funkadelic songs formed the basis of West Coast G-funk.

Original beats that feature funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are also not uncommon. Dr. Dre (considered the progenitor of the G-funk genre) has freely acknowledged to being heavily influenced by George Clinton's psychedelia: ""Back in the 70s that's all people were doing: getting high, wearing Afros, bell-bottoms and listening to Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why I called my album The Chronic and based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big influence on my music. Very big"".[91]Digital Underground was a large contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their listeners with knowledge about the history of funk and its artists. George Clinton branded Digital Underground as ""Sons of the P"", as their second full-length release is also titled. DU's first release, Sex Packets, was full of funk samples, with the most widely known, ""The Humpty Dance"", sampling Parliament's ""Let's Play House"". A very strong funk album of DU's was their 1996 release Future Rhythm. Much of contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily sampled funk drum breaks.

Funk is a major element of certain artists identified with the jam band scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. In the late 1990s, the band Phish developed a live sound called ""cow funk"" (a.k.a. ""space funk""), which consisted of extended danceable deep bass grooves, and often emphasized heavy ""wah"" pedal and other psychedelic effects from the guitar player and layered Clavinet from the keyboard player.[92]Phish began playing funkier jams in their sets around 1996, and 1998's The Story of the Ghost was heavily influenced by funk. While Phish's funk was traditional in the sense that it often accented beat 1 of the 4/4 time signature, it was also highly exploratory and involved building jams towards energetic peaks before transitioning into highly composed progressive rock and roll.

Medeski Martin & Wood, Robert Randolph & the Family Band, Galactic, Jam Underground, Soulive, and Karl Denson's Tiny Universe all drew heavily from the funk tradition. Dumpstaphunk builds upon the New Orleans tradition of funk, with their gritty, low-ended grooves and soulful four-part vocals.

Since the mid-1990s the nu-funk or funk revivalist scene, centered on the deep funk collectors scene, is producing new material influenced by the sounds of rare funk 45s. Labels include Desco, Soul Fire, Daptone, Timmion, Neapolitan, Bananarama, Kay-Dee, and Tramp. These labels often release on 45 rpm records. Although specializing in music for rare funk DJs, there has been some crossover into the mainstream music industry, such as Sharon Jones' 2005 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Those who mix acid jazz, acid house, trip hop, and other genres with funk include Tom Tom Club,[93]Brainticket,[94]Groove Armada, et al.[95][96]

During the 2000s and early 2010s, some punk funk bands such as Out Hud and Mongolian MonkFish performed in the indie rock scene. Indie band Rilo Kiley, in keeping with their tendency to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk into their song ""The Moneymaker"" on the album Under the Blacklight. Prince, with his later albums, gave a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like ""The Everlasting Now"", ""Musicology"", ""Ol' Skool Company"", and ""Black Sweat"". Particle,[97] for instance, is part of a scene which combined the elements of digital music made with computers, synthesizers, and samples with analog instruments, sounds, and improvisational and compositional elements of funk.[98][99]

From the early 1970s onwards, funk has developed various subgenres. While George Clinton and the Parliament were making a harder variation of funk, bands such as Kool and the Gang, Ohio Players and Earth, Wind and Fire were making disco-influenced funk music.[100]

Funk rock (also written as funk-rock or funk/rock) fuses funk and rock elements.[101] Its earliest incarnation was heard in the late '60s through the mid-'70s by musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, Gary Wright, David Bowie, Mother's Finest, and Funkadelic on their earlier albums.

Many instruments may be incorporated into funk rock, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars.  The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more intensity, while the guitar can be funk- or rock-influenced, usually with distortion. Prince, Jesse Johnson, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone are major artists in funk rock.

The term ""avant-funk"" has been used to describe acts who combined funk with art rock's concerns.[102]Simon Frith described the style as an application of progressive rock mentality to rhythm rather than melody and harmony.[102]Simon Reynolds characterized avant-funk as a kind of psychedelia in which ""oblivion was to be attained not through rising above the body, rather through immersion in the physical, self loss through animalism.""[102]

Acts in the genre include German krautrock band Can,[103] American funk artists Sly Stone and George Clinton,[104] and a wave of early 1980s UK and US artists (including Public Image Ltd, Talking Heads, the Pop Group, Gang of Four, Bauhaus, Cabaret Voltaire, Defunkt, A Certain Ratio, and 23 Skidoo)[105] who embraced black dance music styles such as disco and funk.[106] The artists of the late 1970s New York no wave scene also explored avant-funk, influenced by figures such as Ornette Coleman.[107] Reynolds noted these artists' preoccupations with issues such as alienation, repression and technocracy of Western modernity.[102]

Go-go originated in the Washington, D.C., area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as Chuck Brown, the ""Godfather of Go-go"", it is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks.  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response.  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.

Boogie is an electronic music mainly influenced by funk and post-disco. The minimalist approach of boogie, consisting of synthesizers and keyboards, helped to establish electro and house music.  Boogie, unlike electro, emphasizes the slapping techniques of bass guitar but also bass synthesizers. Artists include Vicky ""D"", Komiko, Peech Boys, Kashif, and later Evelyn King.

Electro funk is a hybrid of electronic music and funk. It essentially follows the same form as funk, and retains funk's characteristics, but is made entirely (or partially) with a use of electronic instruments such as the TR-808. Vocoders or talkboxes were commonly implemented to transform the vocals. The pioneering electro band Zapp commonly used such instruments in their music. Bootsy Collins also began to incorporate a more electronic sound on later solo albums. Other artists include Herbie Hancock, Afrika Bambaataa, Egyptian Lover, Vaughan Mason & Crew, Midnight Star and Cybotron.

Funk metal (sometimes typeset differently such as funk-metal) is a fusion genre of music which emerged in the 1980s, as part of the alternative metal movement. It typically incorporates elements of funk and heavy metal (often thrash metal), and in some cases other styles, such as punk and experimental music. It features hard-driving heavy metal guitar riffs, the pounding bass rhythms characteristic of funk, and sometimes hip hop-style rhymes into an alternative rock approach to songwriting. A primary example is the all-African-American rock band Living Colour, who have been said to be ""funk-metal pioneers"" by Rolling Stone.[108] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the style was most prevalent in California – particularly Los Angeles and San Francisco.[109][110]

G-funk is a fusion genre of music which combines gangsta rap and funk. It is generally considered to have been invented by West Coast rappers and made famous by Dr. Dre. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.

Timba is a form of funky Cuban popular dance music. By 1990, several Cuban bands had incorporated elements of funk and hip-hop into their arrangements, and expanded upon the instrumentation of the traditional conjunto with an American drum set, saxophones and a two-keyboard format. Timba bands like La Charanga Habanera or Bamboleo often have horns or other instruments playing short parts of tunes by Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang or other U.S. funk bands.  While many funk motifs exhibit a clave-based structure, they are created intuitively, without a conscious intent of aligning the various parts to a guide-pattern. Timba incorporates funk motifs into an overt and intentional clave structure.

Despite funk's popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. Notable funk women include Chaka Khan, Labelle, Brides of Funkenstein, Klymaxx, Mother's Finest, Lyn Collins, Betty Davis and Teena Marie. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay ""She Was Too Black for Rock and Too Hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis"", most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that ""Betty Davis is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artists like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility.""[111]

In The Feminist Funk Power of Betty Davis and Renée Stout, Nikki A. Greene[112] notes that Davis' provocative and controversial style helped her rise to popularity in the 1970s as she focused on sexually motivated, self-empowered subject matter. Furthermore, this affected the young artist's ability to draw large audiences and commercial success. Greene also notes that Davis was never made an official spokesperson or champion for the civil rights and feminist movements of the time, although more recently[when?] her work has become a symbol of sexual liberation for women of color. Davis' song ""If I'm In Luck I Just Might Get Picked Up"", on her self-titled debut album, sparked controversy, and was banned by the Detroit NAACP.[113] Maureen Mahan, a musicologist and anthropologist, examines Davis' impact on the music industry and the American public in her article ""They Say She's Different: Race, Gender, Genre, and the Liberated Black Femininity of Betty Davis"".

Laina Dawes, the author of What Are You Doing Here: A Black Woman's Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal, believes respectability politics is the reason artists like Davis do not get the same recognition as their male counterparts: ""I blame what I call respectability politics as part of the reason the funk-rock some of the women from the '70s aren't better known. Despite the importance of their music and presence, many of the funk-rock females represented the aggressive behavior and sexuality that many people were not comfortable with.""[114]

According to Francesca T. Royster, in Rickey Vincent's book Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One, he analyzes the impact of Labelle but only in limited sections. Royster criticizes Vincent's analysis of the group, stating: ""It is a shame, then, that Vincent gives such minimal attention to Labelle's performances in his study. This reflects, unfortunately, a still consistent sexism that shapes the evaluation of funk music. In Funk, Vincent's analysis of Labelle is brief—sharing a single paragraph with the Pointer Sisters in his three-page sub chapter, 'Funky Women.' He writes that while 'Lady Marmalade' 'blew the lid off of the standards of sexual innuendo and skyrocketed the group's star status,' the band's 'glittery image slipped into the disco undertow and was ultimately wasted as the trio broke up in search of solo status"" (Vincent, 1996, 192).[115] Many female artists who are considered to be in the genre of funk, also share songs in the disco, soul, and R&B genres; Labelle falls into this category of women who are split among genres due to a critical view of music theory and the history of sexism in the United States.[116]

In the 21st century,[when?] artists like Janelle Monáe have opened the doors for more scholarship and analysis on the female impact on the funk music genre.[dubious  – discuss] Monáe's style bends concepts of gender, sexuality, and self-expression in a manner similar to the way some male pioneers in funk broke boundaries.[117] Her albums center on Afro-futuristic concepts, centering on elements of female and black empowerment and visions of a dystopian future.[118] In his article ""Janelle Monáe and Afro-sonic Feminist Funk"", Matthew Valnes writes that Monae's involvement in the funk genre is juxtaposed with the traditional view of funk as a male-centered genre. Valnes acknowledges that funk is male-dominated, but provides insight to the societal circumstances that led to this situation.[117][clarification needed]

Monáe's influences include her mentor Prince, Funkadelic, Lauryn Hill, and other funk and R&B artists, but according to Emily Lordi, ""[Betty] Davis is seldom listed among Janelle Monáe's many influences, and certainly the younger singer's high-tech concepts, virtuosic performances, and meticulously produced songs are far removed from Davis's proto-punk aesthetic. But... like Davis, she also is closely linked with a visionary male mentor (Prince). The title of Monáe's 2013 album, The Electric Lady, alludes to Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, but it also implicitly cites the coterie of women that inspired Hendrix himself: that group, called the Cosmic Ladies or Electric Ladies, was together led by Hendrix's lover Devon Wilson and Betty Davis.""[119]"
"Chillwave","Chillwave (originally considered synonymous with glo-fi and hypnagogic pop) is a music microgenre that emerged in the late 2000s. It is characterized by evoking the popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s while engaging with notions of memory and nostalgia. Common features include a faded or dreamy retro pop sound, escapist lyrics (frequent topics include the beach or summer), psychedelic or lo-fi aesthetics, mellow vocals, slow-to-moderate tempos, effects processing (especially reverb), and vintage synthesizers.
Chillwave was one of the first music genres to develop primarily through the Internet. The term was coined in 2009 by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff to lampoon microgenres and indie acts whose sounds resembled incidental music from 1980s VHS tapes. Prior to this, the music would have been labelled as shoegaze, dream pop, ambient, or indietronica. Leading acts included Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi, who gained attention during 2009's Summer of Chillwave. Washed Out's 2009 track Feel It All Around remains the best-known chillwave song.[19]
Many artists exploited the style's low-budget simplicity, which led to an oversaturation of acts that contributed to the original scene's demise. The phrase chillwave came to be used as a pejorative due to the music's perceived shallowness and reliance on nostalgia. Detractors also criticized the term for having been contrived by media publications. It heralded the early 2010s proliferation of Internet music microgenres, including vaporwave, which originated as an ironic variant of chillwave. By the mid-2010s, chillwave had faded in popularity, with most of the original artists and listeners of the genre shifting focus to other music styles.
Chillwave has been classified as psychedelia,[8] bedroom pop,[2][3] or electropop.[13] Before a specific term for the music was coined, it was described as shoegaze, dream pop,[21][20] ambient, or indietronica.[20] Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe writes that, since at least 1992, the style had existed for one principal reason: stoned, happy college kids listening to records while they fall asleep.[20] Abebe cited Slowdive, Darla Records' Blissed Out ambient compilations, and Casino Versus Japan's eponymous 1998 album as examples.[20] One of the earliest known manifestations of the genre is the Beach Boys' song All I Wanna Do from their 1970 album Sunflower.[22][23] Boards of Canada, whom Abebe says pre-chillwave music was often compared to,[20] were also influential,[24][17] as were Fennesz, and J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts.[25][17]"
"Hip hop music","Hip-hop or hip hop music, also known as rap, and formerly as disco rap,[7][8] is a genre of popular music that originated in the early 1970s from African Americans and Afro-Caribbean immigrants in the Bronx,[9][10][11][12] a borough of New York City.[13][14][15] Hip-hop music originated as an anti-drug and anti-violence genre[16] consisting of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drum beats) that often accompanies rapping, a rhythmic delivery of poetic speech.[17] In the early 1990s, a professor of African American studies at Temple University said, hip hop is something that blacks can unequivocally claim as their own.[18] By the 21st century, the field of rappers had diversified by both race and gender. The music developed as part of the broader hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, breakdancing, and graffiti art.[19][20][21] While often used to refer solely to rapping and rap music, hip hop more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture.[22][23] The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music,[17][24] though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of the culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.[25][26]
Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx.[27] At block parties, DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the break.[28] Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.
Hip hop music was not officially recorded to play on radio or television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre's birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods.[29] Old-school hip hop was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by its disco influence and party-oriented lyrics. The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles and spread around the world. New-school hip hop was the genre's second wave, marked by its electro sound, and led into golden age hip hop, an innovative period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s that also developed hip hop's own album era. The gangsta rap subgenre, focused on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city African American youth, gained popularity at this time. West Coast hip hop was dominated by G-funk in the early-mid 1990s, while East Coast hip hop was dominated by jazz rap, alternative hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Hip hop continued to diversify at this time with other regional styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. Hip hop became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top-selling music genre by 1999.
The popularity of hip hop music continued through the late 1990s to early-2000s bling era with hip hop influences increasingly finding their way into other genres of popular music, such as neo soul, nu metal, and R&B. The United States also saw the success of regional styles such as crunk, a Southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics, and alternative hip hop began to secure a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of its artists. During the late 2000s and early 2010s blog era, rappers were able to build up a following through online methods of music distribution, such as social media and blogs, and mainstream hip hop took on a more melodic, sensitive direction following the commercial decline of gangsta rap. The trap and mumble rap subgenres have become the most popular form of hip hop during the mid-late 2010s and early 2020s. In 2017, rock music was usurped by hip hop as the most popular genre in the United States. In recent years, hip hop's influence has transcended musical boundaries, impacting fashion, language, and cultural trends worldwide.[30][31][32]
Amidst its evolution, hip hop has also been a vehicle for social commentary and political expression, reflecting the struggles and aspirations of marginalized communities. From its roots in the Bronx to its global reach today, hip hop has served as a voice for the disenfranchised, shedding light on issues such as racial inequality, poverty, and police brutality.[33] Artists such as Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, and Kendrick Lamar have used their platforms to address systemic injustices, fostering dialogue and inspiring activism. Hip hop's ability to confront societal issues while simultaneously providing a form of empowerment and self-expression has solidified its significance beyond mere entertainment, making it a significant cultural force worldwide.[34]"
"Afroswing","

Afroswing, also known as Afrobashment, or less commonly Afrobbean, or Afrowave[1][2][3] is a genre of music that developed in the UK during the mid-2010s, derivative of dancehall and afrobeats, with influences from trap, British hip hop, R&B, and grime.[4][5][1][6] Commercially, the genre has been very successful, with many afroswing artists making it into the British charts.[1][7][4][8]

Afroswing is largely defined by its melody rather than a specific tempo.[4] Producer Steel Banglez stated the key elements of afroswing were happy or dark chords that ""make you feel a certain way"", and that ""drum pattern is the most important thing about this whole sound, it's the snare that comes on the third. In hip-hop it comes on the fourth. Coming off the third beat comes from afrobeats.""[9]

Martin Connor, an expert in vocal melodies and rap analysis, described the characteristics of the genre as being ""[..] technically in 4/4, what you will hear over and over again is this recurring pattern made up of three notes that are still repeated in the framework of a 4/4 time signature [..] You can hear the inspirations of Jamaican music in the rhythm except Jamaican music doesn’t have a bass kick and the snare – that’s hip hop, that’s traditional rap. So this is that translation of cultures happening subtly in the instrumentation. Yet it still has a hip hop sensibility in terms of lyrical focus and music videos: cars, money, authenticity, hardness"".[1]

The rise of afroswing is in large part a result of the slow acceptance of African-derived sounds in the UK. The first genre to really embrace African influenced music and push it into the mainstream was UK funky via artists such as Donae'o,[10][11] and in early-2010s, afrobeats, with artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo gaining mainstream success through their afrobeats sound.[4][6][12] Around the same time, artists such as Sneakbo and Timbo were incorporating melodic rap and Caribbean influences into their music. These artists collectively set the foundation for what would later turn into afroswing,[13] and contributed to the rise of youth embracing their African heritage.[10][14][15] In 2010, Sneakbo released ""Touch Ah Button"", an early example of the merger of dancehall and afrobeats influences. In February 2014, Timbo and Mover released ""Ringtone"", which DJ Kenny Allstar credited as opening ""the door to the bridge of Afro-rap and the evolution of Afroswing, which was essentially someone laying a hook over a rap record"".[13]

The rise of producers Jae5, Blairy Hendrix, Joshua Beatz, and rapper J Hus saw the sound begin to distinguish and cement itself.[4][14][16] Together they fused afrobeats, bashment, and trap, along with a melodic style of rapping with gritty, hood lyrical themes derivative of road rap.[17] J Hus and Timbo have both received credit for pioneering the genre.[7][18][13][19]

Due to being a new genre, there was some confusion on what to call it initially.[4] This has led to many people calling the genre 'afrobeats', and whilst there are some similarities, the genre is not quite the same.[1] There also appeared to be cases of the genre having been briefly referred to as almost identical French 'afro trap'.[2][4][20][8] Likewise, simply lumping it up with ""UK rap"" is misleading, because while it is accurate, it disregards the uniqueness of the genre that sets it apart from other strands of UK rap.[21]  Kojo Funds has explicitly stated he is not trying to be defined as an afrobeats artist and to instead refer to his music as afroswing.[22] Blairy Hendrix and Joshua Beatz, producers for J Hus, were in 2014 initially calling their sound ""Traprobeats"", denoting the various influences of afrobeats and trap music.[14] Around the same time, Jabz Daniels was making a similar sound and called his music ""Trapfrobeat"".[23]

The name ""Afroswing"" was initially coined by rapper Kojo Funds, as well as being pushed by prominent producer Juls.[1][5][24] The name was derived from  ""afro"", which in context and quoted by Funds, attributed to African music, with the mixture of drums derived from R&B and dancehall which the genre ""swings"" between using.[1] Afroswing was eventually picked up by Apple Music as their official genre name for the sound.[25]Spotify however, opted to go for ""AfroBashment"", a term coined by Austin Daboh who was hired by BBC 1Xtra, denoting its fusion of bashment and afrobeats styles.[15]

In 2014, J Hus did a popular freestyle on YouTube channel GRM Daily showcasing his distinctive style.[12] The first notable song in the genre was released in 2015, titled ""Dem Boy Paigon"", quickly elevating J Hus' status and becoming a club hit, and soon after ushering in a new wave of artists making similar music.[4][12][14] J Hus' sound was a unique blend of Ghanaian afro-pop, afrobeats, and British rap. J Hus was unique in that he would mix rapping with melodic singing, something uncommon in the scene at the time.[12] 2014 also saw the emergence of MoStack, Tion Wayne, and Geko.[26]

Many new artists began to crop up from 2015 onwards, such as Kojo Funds, Not3s, Don EE, and ZieZie.[26] Kojo Funds, who coined the name 'afroswing', made his break-out single ""Dun Talkin'"" alongside Abra Cadabra in 2016.[22] Lotto Boyzz, a Birmingham-based group, also gained prominence and decided to call their sound 'afrobbean', denoting the fusion of African and Caribbean influences in the sound.[27][28]

The genre has been supported by YouTube channels such as GRM Daily, Link Up TV, and Mixtape Madness, which has allowed artists to easily release music videos to potentially millions of listeners and propagate the genre as a result.[4][12][17] Many afroswing artists, such as J Hus, Not3s, EO, and Ramz, have all had very successful singles in the charts, becoming mainstream acts in their own right.[7] Ramz' single ""Barking"" peaked at number 2 on the UK singles chart, and sold over 500k copies.[1] EO's song ""German"" peaked at number 13,[1][29] and J Hus' single ""Did You See"" got to number 9 on the charts and became the most-streamed single of 2017.[1] Another major artist in the genre, Kojo Funds, gained a ""Best Song Award"" at the MOBO Awards in 2017 for his song ""Dun Talkin'"" with Abra Cadabra. Mostack, Not3s, and Kojo Funds all enjoyed chart success in 2017.[2]

In 2015, a three-member group called WSTRN gained international attention via Drake's OVO Sound Radio, which had played their 2015 breakout single ""In2"" on Beats1.[5]

In 2017, J Hus released his album Common Sense. The album would gain critical acclaim, entering the British charts at number 10, eventually peaking at number 6 and staying on the charts for over 90 weeks.[15][30]

B Young released ""Jumanji"" in 2018. The song became a hit, selling over 600,000 copies and garnering over 40 million streams, also peaking at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart.[31][32]

In 2018, afroswing artists such as WSTRN, Yxng Bane, Not3s, and Hardy Caprio appeared at SXSW festival in Texas, the first time the genre had ever been represented at the festival.[5]

"Alternative hip hop","

Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap and experimental hip hop[2]) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses a wide range of styles that are not typically identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as comprising ""hip hop groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from funk and pop/rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, and even folk.""[3]

Alternative hip hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of mainstream recognition during the early to mid-1990s. While some groups such as Arrested Development and The Fugees managed to achieve commercial success before breaking up, many alternative rap acts tend to be embraced by alternative rock listeners rather than hip-hop or pop audiences.[3]  The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the simultaneous emergence of significantly harder-edged West Coast gangsta rap. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the digital era with a rejuvenated interest in independent music by the general public.

During the 2000s, alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as Outkast and Kanye West. The alternative hip hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the Somali-Canadian poet K'naan and the British artist M.I.A. Alternative hip hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets. The most prominent alternative hip hop acts include A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Hieroglyphics, The Pharcyde, Digable Planets and Black Sheep.[2]

Originating in the late 1980s, in midst of the golden age of hip hop, alternative hip hop was headed primarily by East Coast groups such as De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Brand Nubian, and Digable Planets in subsidiary conjunction by West Coast acts such as The Pharcyde, Digital Underground, Souls of Mischief, Del the Funky Homosapien, and Freestyle Fellowship as well as certain Southern acts such as Arrested Development, Goodie Mob, and Outkast.[4] Similar to the alternative rock movement, alternative hip hop segued into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. Arrested Development, along with The Fugees, stand as some of the first few alternative rap to be recognized by mainstream audiences.[3] The classic debut albums 3 Feet High and Rising,[5]People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, and Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as managing to be both ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip hop music as a whole.[6]

Contrary to alternative rock, which went on to become a mainstay in mainstream music and replaced the glam metal of the previous generation as the most popular form of rock music, alternative hip hop's commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast gangsta rap.[6] With its aggressive tone, nihilistic tendencies, and violent imagery, gangsta rap was considered to be the more entertaining, more lucrative subgenre as signified by the high chart placings, radio success and multiplatinum-selling records of gangsta rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Warren G and N.W.A, who were widely embraced by major record labels and produced a legion of imitators.[6] Albums such as Straight Outta Compton, The Chronic and Doggystyle redefined the direction of hip hop, which resulted in lyricism concerning the gangsta lifestyle becoming the driving force of sales figures.[7] The situation broke way around the mid-90s with the emergence and mainstream popularity of East Coast hardcore rap artists such as Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., and Mobb Deep. Following this development, many alternative rap acts eventually either disbanded or faded into obscurity.[8][9]

In his 1995 book on the current state of hip hop culture, music critic Stephen Rodrick wrote that, at that time, alternative hip-hop had ""drawn little more than barely concealed yawns from other rappers and urban audiences"" and came to the conclusion that the subgenre was a complete failure.[10]

However, a commercial breakthrough came about in the late 1990s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public due to the mainstream success of acts like The Fugees and Arrested Development.[11] While acts such as Slum Village, Common,[12] and the Roots were rising to prominence.[9]

The Fugees saw huge critical and commercial success with the release of their second album, The Score in 1996.[13] The album peaked at number-one on the US Billboard 200 chart,[14] and briefly became the best-selling album of all time.[15] That same year, saw A Tribe Called Quest reached their commercial peak with the release of their album Beats, Rhymes and Life, which reached number-one on the US Billboard 200 and became their best-selling release;[16] while acts such as OutKast and De La Soul released some of their most definitive albums with Atliens and Stakes Is High.[17]

Since the mid-1990s, independent record labels such as Rawkus Records, Rhymesayers, Anticon, Stones Throw and Definitive Jux have experienced lesser mainstream success with alternative rap acts such as Jurassic 5, Little Brother, Talib Kweli, MF DOOM, Atmosphere, Antipop Consortium, Mos Def, Doomtree, Pharoahe Monch, El-P, Quasimoto, Living Legends, CYNE, Blue Scholars, and Aesop Rock. It was in the 2000s that alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as Outkast, Kanye West, and Gnarls Barkley.[18][19]

Not only did Outkast's fifth studio album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2003) receive universal acclaim from music critics and manage to appeal to listeners of all ages spanning numerous musical genres but also spawned two number-one hit singles. The album eventually went on to win a Grammy Award for Album of the Year—making it only the second hip hop album to win the award (The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill being the first) and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[20]

MF DOOM[2] had also been on the come up in the alternative/underground scene after releasing his debut studio album Operation: Doomsday.  He would come back to the hip-hop scene after the dissolving of hip-hop group KMD. Later, he and Madlib's 2004 project Madvillainy would be released in this time period under the illustrious hip-hop duo Madvillain. This album was praised by music critics; and would forever inspire many upcoming artists such as Aminé and Joey Badass.[21]

Gnarls Barkley experienced a surprise hit with their debut single ""Crazy"". Due to high download sales, it reached number-one of the single charts in several countries, including the United Kingdom, where it became the best selling single of 2006.[22] The song was named the best song of 2006 by both Rolling Stone and the Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll.[23][24]Rolling Stone later ranked ""Crazy"" as the number-one song of the entire decade. The song has since been certified double platinum by RIAA.[25] The duo were the recipient of multiple accolades, at the 49th Grammy Awards, they won the awards for Best Urban/Alternative Performance and Best Alternative Music Album.[26]

Industry observers view the 2007 sales competition between Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's Curtis as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone. Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition as being responsible for altering the direction of hip hop and paving the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, ""If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales. 50 lost handily, and it was made clear that excellent song crafting trumped a street-life experience. Kanye led a wave of new artists—Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, Drake, Nicki Minaj—who lacked the interest or ability to create narratives about any past gunplay or drug-dealing.""[27] Similarly, in a retrospective article, Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the album's sales competition with 50 Cent's Curtis as a historical moment in hip hop, writing that it ""highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.""[28]

Several burgeoning artists and groups acknowledge being directly influenced by their 1990s predecessors in addition to alternative rock groups while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, life experiences and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip hop.[29] As traditional rock music continually becomes less synonymous with pop music, more left-of-center artists who are not fully embraced by hip-hop radio have increasingly found inclusion on alternative radio.[30] According to Nielsen SoundScan, contemporary hip-hop acts who increasingly receive domestic airplay on alt-radio include Run the Jewels, Childish Gambino, Logic, Brockhampton, L.I.F.T. and nothing, nowhere.[30] Regarding audiences, according to Jeff Regan, senior director of music programming for the Alt Nation channel on Sirius XM Radio, ""This generation has maybe never even gone to a record store or CD store where there was a hip-hop section and a rock section—it has all been in front of them on a screen.""[30] It is for this reason that recording artists and groups traditionally perceived as rappers are included on his predominantly rock-oriented playlists, saying, ""Whether it's Lil Peep or Brockhampton or Post Malone, we have tried records from all those artists. ... We need some depth perception in the music we're presenting. Whether it's done on a laptop or on an amp and a guitar, I just want to find something new—that's what alternative is supposed to be.""[30]

While some groups managed to achieve commercial success, most alternative rap acts tended to be embraced largely by alternative rock listeners and indie music fans rather than hip-hop or pop audiences.[3] Artists receive limited exposure through commercial radio and other media outlets and primarily rely on campus radio and various independent media channels.[3] Alternative hip hop is the recipient of consistent critical acclaim but is generally shunned by American mainstream media and widely regarded as commercially unappealing.[6] New York radio personality and spoken word artist Imhotep Gary Byrd's single ""The Crown"" was rejected by American radio stations for being ""too Black and too positive.""[31] However, the song was very well received and become a hit in Europe.[31] It reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest record ever to reach the top 10 in the history of the British Charts.[32] Over the years, multiple organizations representing African-Americans such as the National Black Leadership Alliance and the National Congress of Black Women have released statements criticizing how urban radio stations refuse to play rap music that does not demean and degrade black women, censoring out alternative hip-hop artists such as Arrested Development and Dead Prez.[33]Q-Tip, frontman of the highly influential alternative rap group A Tribe Called Quest, had his sophomore solo effort Kamaal the Abstract shelved for nearly a decade after his record label deemed the genre-bending album as sounding uncommercial.[34]Q-Tip was quoted as saying:

I am really disappointed that Kamaal wasn't released. LA Reid didn't know what to do with it; then, three years later, they release Outkast. What Outkast is doing now, those are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract. Maybe even a little more out. Kamaal was just me, guerrilla.[35]

Similarly, BET infamously refused to play ""Lovin' It"", the lead single of North Carolina-based alt-rap duo Little Brother's socio-politically charged concept album The Minstrel Show, which provided a tongue-in-cheek critique of African-American pop culture, on the grounds that the group's music was ""too intelligent"" for their target audience.[36][37] The network was subsequently satirized by the animated series The Boondocks – which regularly features underground/alternative rap as background music – in the banned episode ""The Hunger Strike"". The episode, which portrayed BET as an evil organization dedicated to the self-genocidal mission of eradicating black people through violent, overtly sexual programming, was banned by Cartoon Network and has yet to be aired in the United States.[38]

The alternative hip hop movement is not limited solely to the United States, as genre-defying rappers such as Somali-Canadian poet K'naan, and especially British artist M.I.A. have achieved considerable worldwide recognition. K'naan's 2009 single Wavin' Flag reached number two on the Canadian Hot 100 while its various remixes topped the charts in several countries. Shing02 was chosen for rapping ""Battlecry"", the theme song of the hit hip-hop-influenced chanbara anime Samurai Champloo, which was produced by Japanese jazz rap DJ Nujabes.[39]Time magazine placed M.I.A in the Time 100 list of ""World's Most Influential people"" for having ""global influence across many genres.""[40][41] Groups like the British virtual band Gorillaz also experienced mainstream popularization during this period of time, selling over 20 million albums total between the albums Gorillaz and Demon Days.[42] Today, due in part to the increasing usage of social networking as well as online distribution, many alternative rap artists are able to find acceptance by far-reaching audiences.[29]"
"Crunk","Crunk is a subgenre of southern hip hop that emerged in the early 1990s and gained mainstream success during the early to mid 2000s.[1][2] Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop's more nightclub-oriented subgenres. Distinguishing itself with other Southern hip hop subgenres, crunk is marked and characterized by its energetic accelerated musical tempo, club appeal, recurrent chants frequently executed in a call and response manner, multilayered synths, its pronounced reliance on resounding 808 basslines, and rudimentary musical arrangement. An archetypal crunk track frequently uses a dominant groove composed of a nuanced utilization of intricately multilayered keyboard synthesizers organized in a recurring pattern, seamlessly shifting from a lower to a higher pitch that encompasses the song's primary central rhythm, both in terms of its harmonic and melodic aspects. The main groove is then wrapped up with looped, stripped-down, and crisp 808 dance claps and manipulated snare rolls coupled and accompanied by a bassline of thumping 808 kick drums.[2] The term ""crunk"" was also used throughout the 2000s as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream.[3]  The word derives from its African-American Vernacular English past-participle form, ""crunk"", of the verb ""to crank"" (as in the phrase ""crank up""). It refers to being excited or high on drugs.[4]

The term has been attributed mainly to African-American slang, in which it holds various meanings.[5] It most commonly refers to the verb phrase ""to crank up"". It is theorized that the use of the term came from a past-tense form of ""crank"", which was sometimes conjugated as ""crunk"" in the South, such that if a person, event, or party was hyped-up, i.e. energetic – ""cranked"" or ""cranked up"" – it was said to be ""crunk"".[5]

In publications, ""crunk"" can be traced back to 1972 in the Dr. Seuss book Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!. He uses the term ""Crunk-Car"" without any given definition.[6] The term has also been traced to usage in the 1980s coming out of Atlanta, Georgia nightclubs and meaning being ""full of energy"" or ""hyped"".[7][unreliable source?][unreliable source?][8] In the mid-1990s, crunk was variously defined either as ""hype"", ""phat"", or ""pumped up"". Rolling Stone magazine published ""glossary of Dirty South slang"", where to crunk was defined as ""to get excited"".[3][5]

Outkast has been attributed as the first artist to use the term in mainstream music, in the 1993 track ""Player's Ball"".[9] A seminal year for the genre was 1996, with the releases of Three 6 Mafia album Chapter 1: The End (featuring ""Gette'm Crunk""),[10] and Memphis-based underground hip hop artist Tommy Wright III's album On the Run, which featured the Project Pimp track ""Getting Crunk"".[11]

Rapper and record producer Lil Jon was instrumental in bringing the term further into the mainstream music scene with his 1997 album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. He later released other songs and albums using the term, and has been credited by other artists and musicians as galvanizing use of the term as well as mainstreaming the music genre itself.[8]

Lil Jon further popularized the word with his 2004 album Crunk Juice, and has been credited with inventing the potent alcoholic cocktail by that name. This use of ""crunk"" became synonymous with the meaning ""crazy drunk"". Non-alcoholic drinks, to which alcohol could be added, were manufactured and marketed under the Crunk brand name, with Lil Jon as spokesman.[12][self-published source?]

The term has continued to evolve, taking on a negative stigma with police, parents and the media. In 2011, the company which manufactured ""Crunk"" drink brought out an alcoholic version named ""Crunk Juice"".[13] This drink was allegedly marketed towards 19- to 21-year-olds – those under the US legal drinking age – resulting in Crunk Juice drinking being blamed as a cause of crime or becoming a victim of crime. The mainstream media began publishing stories in which the term ""crunk"" was used to refer to ""crazy and drunk"" criminals.[14]

Musically, crunk is heavily influenced by Miami bass, Eurodance, and 1980s-era call-and-response hip hop. The distinguishing feature of the conventional crunk sound is characterized by its extensive utilization of multilayered synthesizers orchestrated in a recurrent arrangement that seamlessly transitions from a lower to a higher pitch to augment the sound's harmonious and melodic qualities. Furthermore, a crunk composition is also complemented by the presence of resonant 808 bass kick drums, textured with crisp 808 dance-oriented hand claps, and adorned with modulated snare rolls. Looped, stripped-down drum machine dance claps and snare rolls coupled with heavy 808 bassline drum rhythms are usually used. The Roland TR-808 and 909 are among the most popular instruments to create crunk compositions with. The drum machines are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies in the form of ostinato, to create a hypnotic effect, and heavy 808 bass stabs. The tempo of Lil Jon's ""Get Crunk"" is 78 BPM.[15]

The focal point of crunk is more often emphasized on the beat structure rather than the lyrical content therein.  Nevertheless, artists like Lil Jon often convey their lyrics through vigorous vocalization, encompassing chanting, shouting, and screaming. This unconventional approach yields a cacophonous yet intense manifestation of southern hip hop, characterized by its assertive, aggressive, and forceful nature.These lyrics can often be isolated to simple chants (""Where you from?"" and ""You can't fuck with me"" are common examples). Compared with other regional hip hop scenes around the United States, crunk has remained one of American hip hop's club-oriented staples, given the subgenre's particular focus on its allure to club audiences and partygoers who exhibit more energetic musical tastes with a penchant for more dynamic and vibrant musical preferences. Crunk's captivating appeal is expertly tailored to befit the ambient dance floors of Atlanta's southern hip hop nightclub scene, opting for simplistic and repetitious call and response vocal refrains in lieu of more substantive approaches.[3]

Crunk music arose from Miami bass music before 1996[1] in the southern United States, particularly in African American strip clubs of Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis-based hip hop group Three 6 Mafia were ""instrumental for the emergence of the crunk style"" in the mid-to-late 1990s.[3] Two mixtape DJs from Memphis, DJ Paul and Juicy J, started making their original music, which was distinctive with its ""spare, low-BPM rhythms, simplistic chants... and narcotically repetitive, slasher-flick textures"".[3] This duo soon became known as Three 6 Mafia. Frequently featuring rappers such as Project Pat, Lord Infamous, Gangsta Boo, and La Chat on their releases, they became instrumental in the formation of crunk music.[16]

In 1997, in Atlanta, Lil Jon, with his group the East Side Boyz, released their first album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit. These were the first of six albums released by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz. The New York Times denied that Get Crunk, Who Are You With was the first crunk album ever.[1] He was one of the key figures in popularizing crunk during 1998 and 1999, and produced two gold records independently, before signing to TVT Records in 2001. After being named the ""King of Crunk"", Lil Jon went on[17] to make collaborations with many rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Ludacris and pop singer Britney Spears. Nevertheless, crunk was not exclusively associated with Lil Jon and Three 6 Mafia. In its early stages, soloists and groups such as Ying Yang Twins, White Dawg, Bone Crusher, Lil Scrappy, Trillville, YoungBloodZ and Pastor Troy from Atlanta, and David Banner from Mississippi also helped to popularize crunk music.[3]

By the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits such as ""Damn!"", ""Salt Shaker"", ""Get Low"", ""Goodies"", ""Yeah!"" and ""Freek-a-Leek"" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Other hits produced by Lil Jon included ""Shorty Wanna Ride"", ""Presidential"", ""Lovers and Friends"", ""Okay"", ""Come Get Some"", ""Tell Me When to Go"", ""Cyclone"", ""Girlfight"", ""U and Dat"", and ""Touch"". ""Yeah!"" and ""Goodies"" were the first tracks to introduce the fusion substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&B, called crunk&B to the mainstream popular music landscape. Those two tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the mainstream crunk hits of 2004.

The 2003 crunk song  ""Get Low"" (2003), performed by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz with the Ying Yang Twins, is credited as the track which put crunk music into the national spotlight within the mainstream popular music landscape.[18] ""Get Low"" reached the number two position on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart; overall, it spent more than 21 weeks in the charts.[19]  Lil Jon's album, titled Kings of Crunk, which contained ""Get Low"", earned a double  platinum certification from the RIAA. In the past, rappers who did not originate from the Southern regions of the United Stateshad previously shown reluctance in aligning themselves with being linked to the emerging Southern hip hop scene during the early 21st-century. However, this narrative began to shift when both Busta Rhymes, an East coast rapper, and Nelly, a mid-west rap soloist from St. Louis, agreed to collaborate and contribute their talents to remixes of the song ""Get Low"".[18]

In 2004, the independent record label Crunk Incorporated signed a major distribution deal with Reprise/Warner Bros. Records for the crunk group Crime Mob, who released their platinum single ""Knuck If You Buck"". They followed this with their 2006 hit, ""Rock Yo Hips"". In March 2004, R&B singer Houston released his crunk&B hit ""I Like That"", which reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.[20] During the same year, Atlanta-based R&B singer Nivea scored a mainstream hit when her 2004 crunk&B single ""Okay"" reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.[21] On August 26, 2004, Nashville-based rapper Young Buck scored a top 20 summer hit single with his crunk song ""Shorty Wanna Ride"". The song debuted at number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 17 on the chart, becoming one of Young Buck's highest charting singles in his career. In 2005, two crunk&B songs made a presence on the Billboard Hot 100 when the Los Angeles–based R&B singer Brooke Valentine's song ""Girlfight"" reached number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[22] Towards the end of 2005, then up-and-coming R&B singer Chris Brown's ""Run It!"" made its run on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it eventually peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one on November 26, 2005, becoming Brown's first number one hit single to top the chart.[23] Throughout 2005 to 2006, crunk and crunk&B continued its conquest of the Billboard Hot 100, hip hop, and R&B charts (and other charts specializing in music with rapping) while replacing older styles of hip hop and contemporary R&B. On February 1, 2006, San Francisco–based rapper E-40 released his crunk song, ""Tell Me When to Go."" The song was one of the first singles to kick off the hyphy movement on a national level and popularized the phrase ""ghost ride the whip.""[24] The song reached number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and eventually earned a Gold certification by the RIAA ten years later in March 2016. He later followed up the hit single with another Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper ""U and Dat"" released on May 2, 2006, which was a crunk song that was mixed with elements of dirty rap, hyphy, and West Coast hip hop. The song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which has since remained as E-40's highest-charting single as a lead artist to date with the song eventually garnering platinum certification for exceeding 1 million in certified sales by March 2016.[25] Atlanta-based R&B girl group Cherish also gained national prominence with their summer 2006 hit single ""Do It to It""[26] where the song debuted at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of May 20, 2006,[27] later peaking at number 12 for the week of September 2, 2006, and staying on the charts for 21 weeks.[28]

On April 10, 2007, Louisiana-based rapper Hurricane Chris released his hit debut single ""A Bay Bay"", which debuted at number 95 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[29] In its second week, the song rose to number 85; in its third week, it rose 61 places to number 24.[30] The single featured archetypal crunk elements with the song eventually peaking at number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[31][32][33] Rapper Baby Bash released his hit crunk single Cyclone, which debuted at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early August 2007. The song would then reach the top 40 at number 33 on September 15, 2007, and peaked at number 7 by November 3, 2007, for two weeks before being certified double platinum by the RIAA.[34] Houston-based rapper Dorrough's 2009 hit single ""Ice Cream Paint Job"" marked as one of the last crunk tracks to top the Hot 100, alongside various other crunk compositions that had infiltrated the Billboard charts throughout the 2000s. By the end of 2009, crunk had experienced a significant decrease in visibility within the American mainstream music scene after the conclusion of the 2000s, evident by the changes that took place when the genre was eventually superseded by surging popularity of the trap and drill music subgenres as well as the upsurge in the growth of electropop, electrohop, electro-soul and electronic dance music by the early 2010s. The growing interest in crunk music among record producers outside the Southern hip hop music scene led to the development of various subgenres of crunk, including Eurocrunk, crunkcore, crunkczar, aquacrunk, acid crunk and trap, which gained mainstream music popularity throughout the 2010s. The mainstream popular music scene did not witness a minor resurgence of crunk until the mid-2010s, when the American R&B singer Tinashe incorporated crunk and snap elements in her 2015 single ""All Hands on Deck"" featuring Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. The song contained themes of girl power, rebound dating, and self empowerment. The secondary revival of crunk in the realm of mainstream popular music did not occur until the end of the 2010s, when the San Francisco–based female rapper Saweetie sampled Petey Pablo's 2004 crunk hit ""Freek-a-Leek"" for her 2019 hit single ""My Type."" The song marked as one of the last crunk compositions to achieve significant mainstream success on the US Billboard 100 as the decade came to a conclusion."
"Emo rap","

Emo rap is a fusion genre of hip hop and emo music.[7] Originating in the SoundCloud rap scene in the mid-2010s,[8] the genre fuses characteristics of hip hop music, such as beats and rapping, with the lyrical themes, instrumentals, and vocals commonly found in emo music. Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Juice Wrld are some of the most notable musicians in the genre.[9]

Publications have described emo rap as taking influence from hip hop,[10][11]emo,[10][11]trap,[7]pop punk,[12]nu metal,[10]indie rock,[7]post-hardcore,[13] and cloud rap.[11]

Emo rap departs from the ""traditional"" tones found in modern mainstream hip hop in favor of more emotional and personal lyrical content,[14][15] described by the Wall Street Journal as ""giving their elders the finger.""[16] Lyrics tend to focus on topics such as depression,[17]loneliness, anxiety,[18]consumption of drugs and alcohol, nihilism,[19] suicide,[10] heartbreak,[20] and self-medication.[21] The genre is characterized by its combination of musical elements commonly found in conscious hip hop with indie rock instrumentals.[22]Sampling often uses 2000s pop punk and emo songs. Much of the sampling has been influenced by artists who inspired the genre, such as Mineral, Underoath, and the Postal Service.[23][24] Some emo rappers also make use of original instrumentation.[25] Horse Head of the collective GothBoiClique has described the music as ""...sort of nostalgic, but it's new too...no one's really done shit like this. It's like emo rap and melodic trap"".[26]

Fans of the music are sometimes referred to as ""sad boys"", in reference to emo rapper Yung Lean's music group by the same name.[3][27][28]

Prior to emo rap solidifying itself as a genre, the term was applied by critics to rappers such as Joe Budden,[29]Eminem,[30][31][32]Kanye West,[33] and Drake[34][35] due to their emotional styles of lyric writing. American rapper Slug of Atmosphere claimed in 2017 that he invented the name ""emo rap"" in an IR Magazine article from 1997.[21] The music of German rapper Casper, which was influenced by both hip hop and bands like Give up the Ghost, Modern Life is War, and Grave Digger, was often referred to as ""emo rap"" early on in his career.[36]Huffington Post writer Kia Makarechi described American group Hollywood Undead as ""crass emo-rap"" in 2012 article.[37]

Additionally, between the 1990s and early-2010s, there was a number of significant crossovers between the hip hop scene and the emo and pop punk scene. Zebrahead have been playing a style of music that features vocalist Ali Tabatabaee rapping over pop punk instrumentals since the band's formation in 1995.[38] Rapper MC Lars has been making use of samples and references to emo and pop punk songs in his music since his 2004 debut album.[39][40] Pop punk band Good Charlotte, often stated that they took influence from hip hop and in 2007 released the album Greatest Remixes, which consisted of a number of their previously released songs being remixed by both hip hop and pop punk musicians such as Jay E, Patrick Stump, Marshall Goodman, and William Beckett. In 2005, Stump and Pete Wentz founded DCD2 Records, which signed both emo and hip hop artists, who would often collaborate and tour alongside one another. DCD2 signees Cobra Starship and Gym Class Heroes also merged elements of both genres. In 2006, rapper Kanye West remixed emo pop band Fall Out Boy's song ""This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race"". Fearless Records released the album Punk Goes Crunk in 2008, which was made up of emo and pop punk musicians covering popular hip hip songs. Emo band Framing Hanley covered rapper Lil Wayne's song ""Lollipop"" in 2008 and Lil Wayne went on to collaborate with emo band Weezer in 2009, on the song ""Can't Stop Partying"" off of the band’s album Raditude.[12] Also in 2012, prominent pop-punk band Blink-182 featured rapper Yelawolf on the track ""Pretty Little Girl"" from their Dogs Eating Dogs EP.[41]

In 2013, Swedish rapper and member of the Sad Boys collective, Yung Lean, released ""Ginseng Strip 2002"" and the highly influential mixtape Unknown Death 2002, which publications such as the Guardian and Recording Arts Canada have regarded as cementing Yung Lean as the ""father of emo rap"".[42][43][44]

Emo rap was pioneered by Bones,[45] whose VHS-recorded music videos and dark production and aesthetic were so influential on the hip hop underground of the time that Dazed described him as the ""underground rap king.""[46] In 2012, members of Thraxxhouse, a subgroup of Raider Klan, formed GothBoiClique (GBC),[47] with the intention of drawing connections between the emo, trap, dark wave, black metal, and indie rock scenes. Bones and other genre pioneers like Black Kray and 90's Bambino also drew heavily upon the influence of witch house.[48][49] GBC's style of emo rap influenced swathes of artists in the underground emo and hip hop scenes on SoundCloud,[49] with Lil Lotus,[50]Lil Peep[51] and Lil Tracy,[47] all citing the group as an influence and the latter-most two even eventually becoming members. During this time, a DIY ethos came to define the genre,[52][53] to the extent that when Shinigami released his debut album Luna on Spotify, he was derided as a sellout, due to the streaming service's ability to monetize.[54]

In 2017, Lil Uzi Vert's song ""XO Tour Llif3"" became a sleeper hit. The song, characterized as emo hip hop[55] due to its lyrics referring to suicide and emotional breakdowns peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[56][57] In August 2017, XXXTentacion released his debut album 17 with the lead single ""Jocelyn Flores"" which addresses the suicide of a friend[58] and Lil Uzi Vert released their debut studio album Luv Is Rage 2. The release of both the projects and their high peak on the Billboard 200 became defining moments for emo rap in the mainstream.[59][60] At the same time, Lil Peep was branded by Pitchfork the ""future of emo"" in January 2017[61] and in April 2017, The Guardian concluded that his ""continuing rise is testament to the timeless appeal of introspection.""[62]

In November 2017, Lil Peep died of a Fentanyl overdose.[64][65] Shortly afterwards, Lil Peep's debut studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 and the lead single ""Awful Things"" charted on the Billboard charts.[66] His death brought increased notability to the genre as a whole and particularly to artists such as Trippie Redd and Lil Aaron.[67][68] In June 2018, XXXTentacion was murdered, and like Peep, his albums 17 and ? charted the following week, along with his hit song ""SAD!"" charting at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[69] In September 2018, a posthumous collaboration between the two artists, ""Falling Down"" was released and became certified platinum in the US.[70] The same year, emo rap was the fastest-growing genre on Spotify in 2018.[71] In December 2019, Juice WRLD died after suffering a seizure, induced by an overdose of oxycodone and codeine.[72] He was known to most people for the songs ""All Girls Are the Same"" and ""Lucid Dreams"", the latter which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2018 and returned to the chart in 2019 at number eight following his death.[73]

In 2018, Nothing,Nowhere released his second album Reaper, which was described by the New York Times as an ""outstanding album that synthesizes the second-wave emo of the early to mid-2000s [sic] with the rattling hip-hop low end of the last few years. It is one of the most promising pop albums of the year; the logical, and perhaps inevitable, endpoint of hip-hop’s broad diffusion into every corner of American musical life; and also the most viable current direction for guitar-driven music in the mainstream.""[74]Revolver described him as one of the leading stars of the emo rap movement.[75] Also in 2018 and 2019, notable emo rappers 24kGoldn,[76]Poorstacy,[77][78]the Kid Laroi,[79]Powfu[80] and Iann Dior[81] were all signed by labels where they released their debut EPs. On February 8, 2020, Powfu released their single ""Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head)"" with Beabadoobee, which peaked at number one on the U.S. Hot Rock/Alternative Songs chart.[82] On July 24, 2020, Dior and 24kGoldn released the chart-topping song ""Mood"",[83][84] which is currently certified quadruple platinum.[85]Forbes described 2020 as ""The Year Rap Artists Rule the Rock Charts"",[82] while Spin writer Al Shipley described the merger of pop punk and rap as 2020's ""commercial juggernaut"".[86] In March 2022, emo rapper Lil Bo Weep died of a drug overdose after a long struggle with depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder after the loss of a child.[87]

The popularity of emo rap led to a number of mainstream musicians incorporating elements of it into their music in the late-2010s and early-2020s. Notable artists to do so include Justin Bieber,[88]Ariana Grande,[89] and Miley Cyrus.[90]

Emo rap, along with styles like cloud rap, trap, dubstep, trance, chiptune and pop music were influential on the development of the hyperpop genre.[91] The genre gained mainstream attention in the late-2010s and early-2020s through artists such as 100 gecs, Charli XCX, and Dorian Electra.[92]

The genre also brought about a revived interest in pop punk in the mainstream.[93][94] This interest led to the 2020s pop punk revival.[95] In particular, Machine Gun Kelly's album Tickets to My Downfall was described by the Evening Standard as ""bridg[ing] the gap"" between the contemporary pop punk and emo rap scenes.[96] During this time, a number of emo rappers such as Trippie Redd,[97]Lil Tracy,[98]Cold Hart,[99]Lil Aaron,[100] and 24kGoldn[101] also began releasing pop punk albums and songs."
"Brooklyn drill","Brooklyn drill is a regional subgenre of drill music, which is a subgenre of rap music. It centered in Brooklyn, New York, that began as derivative of the drill music scene in Chicago and later became derivative of UK drill with its 808 percussion and sliding notes by producers from the UK drill scene.[1][2][3] Brooklyn drill emerged around 2014 with the single ""Hot Nigga"" from the rapper Bobby Shmurda.[4][5] Other early contributors were Rowdy Rebel, Bam Bino, Money Millz, Dah Dah and Curly Savv.[6]

In 2019, the subgenre was repopularized in the mainstream by rap artist, Pop Smoke.[7][8][9] With the success of his mixtapes, particularly the songs ""Dior"" and ""Welcome to the Party"", Pop Smoke introduced Brooklyn drill into the mainstream music industry.[10][11][12]

Brooklyn drill music first gained attention with the 2014 single ""Hot Nigga"" from the rapper Bobby Shmurda.[4][5] Other early pioneers were rappers Bam Bino, Dah Dah and Curly Savv.[6] The genre is agreed to have been driven by 22Gz and Sheff G, largely scaling the potential of the movement.[13] The music became more popular and associated with UK drill production (from producers such as 808Melo, AXL Beats, and Ghosty) with the releases of 22Gz's ""Suburban"" in 2016 and Sheff G's ""No Suburban"" in 2017. Both songs went viral and were credited for the rise of Brooklyn drill.[14][15]

Brooklyn drill music reached mainstream Billboard Hot 100 success with tracks from Pop Smoke (""Welcome to the Party"", ""Dior"", and ""Gatti"") and Fivio Foreign (""Big Drip"" and ""Demons"").[16][17][18] Pop Smoke was nominated for a 2021 Grammy Award for ""Dior.""[19][20][21][22][23] 
After Pop Smoke's 2020 murder in the Hollywood Hills, Brooklyn drill would continue to evolve.[24][25][26][27][28]
With the groundwork Pop Smoke laid, the broader drill scene of Brooklyn began to emerge.[29] 
One example is Staten Island rapper CJ, whose hit song ""Whoopty"" is reminiscent of the Brooklyn drill sound.[30]

The Brooklyn drill sound is a combination of trap, Chicago drill and UK drill (the latter of which brings production influences from grime and UK garage).[31] Characteristic features of Brooklyn drill production include distorted 808 percussions with vocal sampling from other popular tracks.[32][33] Brooklyn drill lyrics tend to be dark, violent, and street-oriented, often discussing gang-related topics.

In 2022, some drew connections between the glorification of gun violence in the genre to real-world gun violence on the streets of New York that had resulted in the deaths of a number of young drill artists, mostly those with origins of Brooklyn and the Bronx.[34][35][36][37][38]

The same year, several prominent New York DJs said they would stop playing gang/diss records in response to the deaths of a growing number of young people involved in the drill scene. [39][40][41]

In February 2022, NYC mayor Eric Adams directed some venue promoters not to allow drill music to be performed at festivals in the city following the killing of 18-year-old rapper C-HII Wvttz.[42] Adams met with musicians for a conversation on how to approach concerns about drill culture's connections, if any, to gun violence. Artists at the meeting included Maino, Fivio Foreign, B-Lovee, CEO Slow, Bucksy Luciano and Bleezy.[43]

Bronx drill[44] is a subgenre of Brooklyn drill music, which uses uncleared samples of older records instead of synthesizers like in Brooklyn drill.[45]

Bronx drill originated during the early 2020s in New York (most prominently, in The Bronx), where producers such as Cash Cobain, EPondabeat,[44] WAR,[44] EvilGiane,[44] and others, started re-using older funk and soul, and pop music songs to create modern yet nostalgic sound. A number of rappers subsequently joined the scene, most prominently, Kay Flock, B-Lovee, Ron Suno, DThang Gz, Jay5ive and others.[45]

The easily recognizable samples in Bronx drill are also said to increase its viral potential. Songs, such as B-Lovee's ""My Everything"" (sampling ""Everything"" by Mary J. Blige)[44] gained over 400,000 uses on TikTok and produced two remixes, featuring A Boogie wit da Hoodie and G Herbo. Another early TikTok viral Bronx drill hit was ""Deep End Freestyle"" (sampling Fousheé's ""Deep End"") by Brooklyn native Sleepy Hallow. Despite playing a huge role in genre's spread, Cash Cobain refused to acknowledge that Bronx drill musicians mostly do songs for TikTok.[45] EPondabeat, another producer involved in the scene, claimed that sampling in used for marketing purpose to invoke listener's relatability.[44]

Bronx drill rappers employ a variety of lyrical delivery styles, with those in the Bronx drill scene using a particularly aggressive style. ""These little kids from the Bronx are wild. They on demon time. They're angrier with their shit,"" one producer said.[45]

Samples for Bronx drill come from a variety of sources and these sources may differ depending on producer. Bronx-based Cash Cobain mainly uses round-the-century contemporary R&B and hip hop music sources;[44][46] meanwhile, EPondabeat, EvilGiane prefer to use soul music and funk recordings for sampling; other producers, such as WAR, do not limit themselves among sampling sources.[44]

Most Bronx drill songs are not granted clearance to sample other works until they've already gained popularity, with some artists saying they don't care to clear their samples at all.[45][46]

Bronx drill, since its inception around 2020, already had a mainstream crossover, when Cardi B performed on ""Shake It"" by Kay Flock.[45] Bronx drill has also influenced Jersey drill sound[45] and more commercial drill sound, most particularly the influence can be heard on B.I.B.L.E. by Fivio Foreign, where he sampled ""Say My Name"" by Destiny's Child.[45]

The Bronx producer Cash Cobain has been described by Complex Music as inventing sexy drill which tones down the violent nature of drill, while still drawing on the sampling techniques. Cobain said, ""I think everybody wants to feel good, party, and just feel sexy"". Complex wrote that Cobain is ""changing the sound of New York"".[47]

Ice Spice and Kenzo B emerged from the Bronx drill scene.[48][49]"
"Latin trap","

Latin trap is a subgenre of Latin hip hop music that originated in Puerto Rico. A direct descendant of southern hip hop, and influenced by reggaeton, it gained popularity after 2007, and has since spread throughout Latin America. The trap is slang for a place where drugs are sold.[2] Latin trap is similar to mainstream trap with lyrics about life on la calle (the street), drugs, sex and violence.[2][1]

Latin trap is a subgenre of Latin hip hop, taking influence from Southern hip hop as well as Puerto Rican genres like reggaeton and dembow. Vocals include a bend of rapping and singing using synthesizers and voice distorted autotune, often in Spanish, while still maintaining the trap style sonic circuitry.[3] The lyrics in Latin trap are often about street life, violence, sex, drugs, and people who live on the other side of the law and are proud of it.[1]

Latin trap originated in Puerto Rico and gained popularity throughout Latin America. The exact date of origin is unknown and has been widely debated. Puerto Rican reggaeton and Latin trap singer Ozuna states that it originated in 2007 with the song ""El Pistolón"", performed by Arcángel & De la Ghetto, Yaga & Mackie, and Jowell & Randy (the former two were duo at the time). De la Ghetto on the other hand, states that he has been performing Latin trap since around 2005 or 2006, and that people thought ""he was crazy"". Reggaeton artists at this time wanted to introduce elements of American hip hop and R&B to a Spanish audience.[4]

Latin trap began to gain prominence around 2014 when artists such as Alvaro Diaz, Myke Towers and Fuete Billete, the first Puerto Rican artists using early Latin trap beats to rap, began posting their songs through social media platforms. In mid-2015, Cuban artist TRAUMATIZE from Miami, FL releases ""Aguadulce"" Latin trap record, a collaborator of the American Hip Hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. This new sound eventually gained popularity in Puerto Rico, and many Latin trap hits emerged, such as Anuel AA’s ""47 Remix"" Bryant Myers' ""Esclava Remix"", Farruko's ""Ella y Yo"", and De la Ghetto's ""La Ocasión"", the latter to which Ozuna and Anuel AA credits with expanding Latin trap internationally.[5]

A Spanish version of ""Panda"" was released by Almighty on the Miami-based label Carbon Fiber Music.[6] The single reached #36 on Hot Latin Songs and #23 on Latin Rhythm Airplay. Borrowing the original version's beat, it features Farruko, owner of said label, while a subsequent remix adds Daddy Yankee and Cosculluela.[7] Additionally, Anuel AA released a scathing diss track towards Almighty, entitled ""RIP Panda"", after being taken down from the remix.[8]

In July 2017, The Fader wrote: ""Rappers and reggaetoneros from Puerto Rico have taken elements of trap – the lurching bass lines, jittering 808s and the eyes-half-closed vibe – and infused them into banger after banger.""[9] In an August 2017 article for Billboard's series, ""A Brief History Of"", they enlisted some of the key artists of Latin trap, including Ozuna, De la Ghetto, Bad Bunny, Farruko and Messiah- to narrate a brief history on the genre.[10][11] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone noted: ""[Jorge] Fonseca featured Puerto Rican artists like Anuel AA, Bryant Myers and Noriel on the compilation Trap Capos: Season 1, which became the first ""Latin trap"" LP to reach number one on Billboard's Latin Rhythm Albums chart.""[12]

Many other reggaeton and Latin trap artists contributed to the popularity of Latin trap, such as Bad Bunny who led an explosion to the popularity of the genre.[13] Bad Bunny produced several songs that made it into Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart and has multiple collaborations with popular American artists such as Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, and Cardi B.[14][15] He shortly became the face of Latin trap's sudden rise in popularity.[16] Through collaborations with other artists, such as his appearance in Becky G's ""Mayores"", Bad Bunny was among the first Latin trap artists to ever rap on the radio. His appearance on the radio has led to an increased recognition of Latin trap in the United States.[16] His debut album X 100pre was released in December 2018 and was awarded with a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album.[17]

In April 2018, the song ""Te Boté"", a mix of Latin trap and reggaeton, was released by Nio García, Casper Mágico, Darell, Ozuna, Bad Bunny and Nicky Jam.[18] It became the first song with Latin trap elements in it to reach number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. It currently has over 2 billion views on YouTube.[19]

In 2018, Cardi B's hit single ""I Like It"" featuring Bad Bunny and J Balvin became the first Latin trap song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.[20][21]

J Balvin and Bad Bunny appear at the 2020 Super Bowl Halftime Show performing Latin trap songs for the first time in history.[22]

Bad Bunny is the most influential Latin trap artist being named one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People of 2021.[23] Bad Bunny is currently at his peak being named Spotify's most streamed artist of 2021 and 2022. On May 6, 2022 Bad Bunny released his album Un Verano Sin Ti reaching the milestone of most-streamed artist globally in one day, with 183 million streams.[24] In 2023, Bad Bunny released his album, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana, which was considered one of his first true Latin trap albums since 2020.

Young Miko is emerging onto the Latin trap scene due to her album TRAP KITTY in 2022. She has landed two major collaborations with Bad Bunny and Feid, which were Hot 100 hits.[25]"
"Afro house","

Afro house (also spelled as Afro-house or Afrohouse)[1] is a sub-genre of house music mainly developed in South Africa.[2] The genre emerged in the 1990s.[3][4] It was broadly internationally spearheaded by Malaika, Black Coffee, DJ Fresh,[5]DJ Tira, Zakes Bantwini, DJ Cndo, Da Capo, Bucie, Culoe De Song, Shimza, Punk Mbedzi, Enoo Napa and Black Motion.[6][7][8]

Since kwaito was already developed in South Africa before or possibly during the emergence of afro house.[4] It appears the name made immediate differentiation usage of the prefix 'afro', which in context by definition literally means anything relating to Africa and African culture[9] as well as, the seemingly obvious suffix, 'house', in direct relation to house music.

The genre is principally a blend of traditional house, kwaito, mbaqanga, deep house, tribal house, and soulful house.[2] It features various South African languages.[6][10] The BPM commonly shifts between 80 and 122 and in some instances, up to even 160.[2][10][11]

South African record label, Afrotainment (Ezase Afro)[12] housed one of the first notable female Afro house artists, namely, DJ Cndo[8] in the early 2000s.[13][14] Her debut album released in 2007, Finest Lady of House Vol.1 obtained gold record status, which would likely have  been considered a momentous achievement, during the CD records, era.[15][16]

Vocalist, Bucie is regarded as ""the female voice of South African house music"",[17][18] presumably Afro house especially in reference to one of her Afro house hit singles ""Superman""[19][20] which was produced by Black Coffee in 2009 and was later sampled by Drake in 2017 for his More Life album featuring Jorja Smith.[21] British  ""Kiss From A Rose"", songster Seal claimed that he liked her music and mentioned that Bucie is ""a great singer and artist"".[19]

In 2012, DJ Zinhle  ""My Name Is""  featuring Busiswa hitmaker,[22] co-founded Fuse Academy. A DJ academy specifically for female,DJs.[23]

In 2016, songstress Alicia Keys enlisted Black Coffee for one of her ""In Common"" official remixes,[24] which was recognized and received well, internationally.[25] Zimbabwean, Songwriter and singer, Jackie Queens launched her record label Bae Electronica which solely showcases women house artists, such as Thandi Draai[26] who according to Mixmag has been ""heralded as SA house music's femmetastic triple-threat"".[15][27][28]

Ostensibly before it was 'officially' named and categorized as a sub-genre, it was just referred to as simply, ""house"".[29][4]

The genre appeared to have been, in some cases unintentionally labeled and mistaken as UK funky or afrobeats, ostensibly due to unawareness and ignorance.[30]

Foreseeably, many former  kwaito and kwaito-correlating artists for instance Oskido, DJ Tira, Mafikizolo,[31]Black Coffee,[24]DJ Cleo,[32]Thandiswa Mazwai,[33]Big Nuz[34] and Mahoota (member of Trompies)[35] have been ceaselessly associated with the genre for decades.[4][8]

Other ceasless artists include  Osunlade, Louie Vega, Pablo Fierro,[36] Darque, Djeff Afrozila, Jazzuelle, Hyenah,[37] Rancido, Floyd Lavine,[36] Boddhi Satva[38] and Keinemusik Crue(Kloud).[6][39][40]

The genre is thought to have possibly been, in effect created in the late 1980s due to the hitherto heavy, presence of kwaito, mbaqanga and house both locally as well as internationally.[41][4] This time period was unfortunately during the apartheid regime whereas information would evidently have not been easy to record nor share.[42] Kwaito-associated acts such as Brenda Fassie and Sipho Mabuse were high-charting artists on global charts such as on KISS-FM and Capitol Radio during the 1980s and 1990s.This would outwardly be the world's first introduction to ""South African house music"".[43] Artists such as Vinny Da Vinci,DJ Christos and Revolution twins[44] were hosting parties and  DJing in various locations.[4]

I was working in townships before [Apartheid ended], and I'd get a lot of shit if I was caught. I mean, even name-wise I was never Christos. I changed my name like five times to avoid the cops.

During this period the genre's universality in various locations such as the United States was set in stone. American artists such as Grammy-award-winning, Louie Vega  had been regularly frequenting South Africa during this time.[3] There is also evidence of the genre having being popularized in Angola due to the local dance culture. This is partially attributed to the musical genre kuduro.[45][46]

In 1994, the South African record label House Afrika was established. The label was founded by Vinny Da Vinci (Vincent Motshegoa),[47] Tim White and DJ Strat3gy(Glen van Loggerenberg). The label's debut album release was titled Fresh House Flava Vol.1 by DJ Fresh.[citation needed]

Some had friends at airlines and would ask them to bring tracks back in their luggage. Others would pay people to be couriers and get tunes into the country. Whether you call this bootlegging, or contraband, you made the most of any way you could get at the music.

In 2001, House Afrika released ""Oskido's Church Grooves"".[48]

In 2003, Malaika's ""Destiny"" topped, charts.[49] The South African trio toured Australia alongside Zimbabwean, singer Tarisai Vushe who made it to the Top.5 of Australia Idol, 2007 as their supporting act.[50]

In 2005, South African Grammy-award-winning artist, Black Coffee released his debut self-titled album Black Coffee.The album appeared to be the first afro house album to win the South African Music Awards, Best Dance Album, category and featured other distinguished South African artists such as Hugh Masekela and Thandiswa Mazwai.[51][33]

The genre had subsequently become popularized in even more parts of the world including South America, Europe, and Asia.[6][52] In, London although already conceivably, presumbably present since the 1980s, its emergence appeared to have become solidified during this period as well as to a greater extent accredited to ""giving rise to"" the, UK funky, scene.[53]

Notable Afro house record labels include:"
"Gqom","Gqom ([ᶢǃʱòm]) (igqomu ([iᶢǃʱòmu]), gqom tech or sghubu),[10] is an electronic dance music genre and subgenre of house music that emerged in the early 2010s from Durban, South Africa,[11] pioneered largely by music producers Naked Boyz, Sbucardo, DJ Lag,[12][13][14] Rudeboyz,[12][15][16][17] Nasty Boyz, Griffit Vigo,[18][19]Distruction Boyz,[20] Menzi Shabane[21][22] and Citizen Boy.[23][24] It was developed from kwaito, a subgenre of house from South Africa.[25]

Unlike other South African electronic music, gqom is typified by minimal, raw and repetitive sound with heavy bass beats but without the four-on-the-floor rhythm pattern.[11]

Music connoisseurs who were pivotal in influencing the genre's international acclaim included the likes of South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat, Italian record label Gqom Oh owner, Malumz Kole[26] inclusive of other South Africans; music taste-maker and public relations liaison, Cherish Lala Mankai,[26] Afrotainment record label owner DJ Tira, Babes Wodumo, Dlala Thukzin,[27] and Busiswa.

The word gqom derives from an onomatopoeic combination of click consonants in the Zulu language meaning a hitting drum. It is also expressed as GQOM (stylization), gqom tech, qgom, igqom, gqomu, 3 step (as a moniker) due to the genre's display of rhythmic patterns or variants thereof.[28] Presumably another name is sghubu as its direct translation from the Zulu language is drum, furthermore it is a local word used to describe house or the drum instrument, in general ,whilst being a sub-genre of gqom itself, too.[29][30][10][31]

Gqom is known for its beats which have a minimal, raw and repetitive sound with heavy bass as well as incorporations of techno. It is mainly described as having a dark and hypnotic club sound. The style of beats does not use the four-on-the-floor rhythm pattern which is often heard in other house music.[11] Typical lyrical themes include nightlife. It often uses one phrase or a few lines which are repeated numerous times in the song. Gqom was developed by a young generation of technologically skilled DJs producing in D.I.Y. fashion with software such as FL Studio and often self distributing their music on file sharing platforms.[24]

Partially similar to afro tech, gqom likewise is referred to as, ""3 Step"". In 2016, gqom pioneer Sbucardo characterized gqom as having a three-step rhythm and monickered gqom explicitly as 3 Step.[26] Gqom as well as afro tech producers and DJs often blend these two genres (gqom and afro-tech), together.[32][27] Illustrations would be that of Culoe De Song's  2018, ""Poki Returns""[33] and Dlala Thukzin's ""Nika Nika""  (magical remix) featuring Iso and CavaTheKwaal, from his 2020, Permanent Music, EP.[34][35] In 2021, Dlala Thukzin released Phuze (remix) featuring Mpura, Zaba, Sir Trill and Rascoe Kaos fusing elements of gqom and amapiano into one, song.[36]

Gqom exhibits variances in rhythm, for instance such as alternating between a 3-step or even a 2-step beat.[23]

Gqom emerged in the early 2010s.[11] Influences in the 2010s, cite acts such as Naked Boyz, prominently known for producing the track ""Ithoyizi"" which appeared on Afrotainment signee DJ Cndo's compilation as well as  music producers Blaq Soul and Culoe de Song's inclination towards tribal house which involved experimenting with beat formations. Additionally, in certain Durban nightclubs, early gqom and tribal house seamlessly alternated in DJ sets, while the music of Pretoria and Eastern Cape record producers like DJ Spoko, Machance, DJ Mujava, DJ Mthura and DJ Soso as well as sgxumseni (attributed to DJ Clock and DJ Gukwa) were prevalent during the era.[37][27][38][23]

From the mid-2010s, the genre gained prominence abroad, especially in London.[39] Gqom also plays its part in increasing business profit for local taxis as people established a day to specifically celebrate gqom called ""gqom explosion"" that is mostly known as iNazoke. It is celebrated by people from the city of Durban, but eventually other cities and towns in KwaZulu-Natal started celebrating it, too.[40]

As the genre gained international traction,[26][41] this made way for increased international collaborations as well as popularization. In 2017, lead Empire (2015 TV series), actor Jussie Smollett was sighted dancing to and what appeared to be enjoying,[42] the song ""Omunye"" by Distruction Boyz featuring Benny Maverick[43] and Dlala Mshunqisi.[44] Smollett described the song as ""my jam"".[42]

In 2018, Babes Wodumo made an appearance on the Marvel Comics, Black Panther:Soundtrack album compilation by Kendrick Lamar showcasing a gqom vocal style delivery on the song ""Redemption"",[48] additionally Wodumo collaborated with American electronic group Major Lazer on ""Orkant/Balance Pon It"" and displayed gqom dance moves in the official music video.[49]

In 2023, Scratcha had a back-to-back, mixset with gqom pioneer and Durban native Menzi Shabane.[79][80] DJ Lag colloborated with British grime record producer and MC, Novelist on a single, titled ""Bulldozer"".The song was recorded in London and cited lyrics, ""Big Novelist coming like a bulldozer. But I’ve got the enemy confessing that it’s all over. Never been a shookadem, I’m a true soldier"".[81]

In Japan, a gqom scene emerged, spearheaded by DJ and producer KΣITO, who was initially involved in the Japanese footwork scene. KΣITO's interest in gqom grew in the mid-2010s. In 2016, he released Hatagaya an EP which incorporated gqom. Various other  projects by KΣITO, such as Jakuzure Butoh, drew inspiration from gqom.

KΣITO hosts TYO GQOM nights in Tokyo. Additionally, he established the USI KUVO record label, which serves as a hub for the Japanese gqom scene and released gqom records by Durban gqom artists such as Loktion Boyz. Some Japanese producers such as  Indus Bonze, blend gqom with gorge, an experimental Japanese music style.[82][83]

In France, the Gqommunion collective was initiated in 2017 by Sebastien Forrester and Amzo, the latter associated with the Gqom Oh!, record label. In 2019, Sebastien Forrester released the gqom inspired EP, Salvo, inclusive of coupé-décalé, rhythms.[84]

In 2020, Greek duo Bang La Decks and Dutch producer Wiwek collaborated on a single titled 'GQOM'. They paid tribute to gqom while expressing their admiration for Guinean vocalist Mory Kanté by incorporating Kanté 's vocal from his 1987, single ""Yé ké yé ké"" into the record's production.[citation needed]

Brazilian producers established a bridge between gqom and baile funk, as seen with examples such as JLZ's GQOM IDEIAS EP and State OFF's""I Need Some Baile-GQOM"", song.[85][citation needed]

In 2018, boy band BTS released ""Idol"" from their Love Yourself: Answer album. The was inspired by and encompassed gqom rhythmic elements. Moreover, the band promoted an alternate, digital-only version of the song featuring Trinidadian-American rapper and singer, Nicki Minaj.[86]

In 2021, Mexican music producer OMAAR's, Drum Temple album was inspired by gqom among other genres such as UK funky. Single, ""Drum Dance"" was described as ""a rapturous reinterpretation of gqom and techno, at once resembling an ancient ritual and an intense strength-training session"" by Isabelia Herrera of Pitchfork.[87]

In 2018, Citizen Boy a native of Durban and a pioneer of gqom music, teamed up with Nigerian singer Dapo Tuburna to produce the single ""Alala"" .The song was featured on the B-Side, Citizen Boy's EP titled, Gqom Fever. ""Alala"" was a blend of gqom and afrobeats.[88] Songwriter and singer Yemi Alade featured on ""My Power"" in, 2019.[55] In 2022, MOVES Recordings released its second compilation, titled Cruise highlighting the Nigerian ""cruise"" or ""freebeat"" sound featuring an amalgamation of gqom, techno, amapiano, afrobeats, a sample of a Nollywood actor or televangelist and other genres. The compilation comprised DJ Stainless, DJ Elede, DJ YK, DJ West, Fela 2 and DJ OP Dot.[89][90] In 2020, DJ Yk Mule and Portable Zazu's, ""Zazu Beat"", was released.[90] In 2022, ""Zazoo Zehh"" by Poco Lee, Portable and rapper Olamide made its debut on Billboard Global 200.[91][92]

Ugandan, Nyege Nyege's  record label Nyege Nyege Tapes, dropped gqom records featuring Durban gqom pioneers , gqom record producers and vocalists such as Menzi Shabane, trio Phelimuncasi (consisting of Malathon as well as twin vocalists Makan Nana and Khera), Ugandan DJ Scoturn, DJ Ndakx and DJ Nhlekzin.[21][93][94]

In 2018, Nicki Minaj collaborated with BTS on ""Idol"". In 2019, American rapper and singer Tierra Whack and record producer as well as songwriter Nija Charles featured on Beyoncé's ""My Power"".[55][95] Beyoncé's, 2022 Renaissance  studio album, incorporated gqom among other genres.[96] In 2024, Franchise released, ""Satisfaction"".[citation needed]

In 2024, Bandung DJ and music producer REYY released a song titled, ""Tokyo Gqom"", a remix of Teriyaki Boyz' 2006 single,""Tokyo Drift (Fast & Furious)"".[citation needed]

Gqom music is associated with a number of distinctive dance moves, including gwara gwara, vosho and bhenga.[97]

Gwara gwara is performed by rolling and swinging the arm and the elbow in terms of making a circle, and one of the leg moves in connection with the arm's rhythm. It appears to have some similarities to the stanky legg.[98]Gwara gwara[99] was made famous by South Africans DJ Bongz and musician Babes Wodumo.[100][49] The dance move was created by disc jockey and producer DJ Bongz, it was heavily imitated by South Africans and other African people mainly during 2016.[101][102] It also received widespread popularization globally as the choreography was adopted by notable musicians: Rihanna performed the dance move while performing ""Wild Thoughts"" at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018. Childish Gambino performed the dance in the video of his song ""This Is America"".[103] BTS performed the dance in the choreography for their song ""Idol"".[86]"
"Styles of house music","



These genres have origins partly in house music, and may have 'house' in the title, but they belong to other genres of electronic music."
"Chicago house","Chicago house refers to house music produced during the mid to late 1980s within Chicago. The term is generally used to refer to the original house music DJs and producers from the area, such as Ron Hardy and Phuture.

Following Chicago's Disco Demolition Night in mid-1979, disco music's mainstream popularity fell into decline. In the early 1980s, fewer and fewer disco records were being released, but the genre remained popular in some Chicago nightclubs and on at least one radio station, WBMX-FM.

In this era, Chicago radio jocks The Hot Mix 5, and club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played various styles of dance music, including older disco records, newer Italo disco, electro, EBM tracks, B-boy hip hop music by Man Parrish, Jellybean Benitez, Arthur Baker and John Robie as well as electronic pop music by Kraftwerk, Telex and Yellow Magic Orchestra.

Some of these DJs also made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, focusing on the portions of songs which worked well on the dancefloor. Some even mixed in effects, drum machines, and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation in an effort to give songs more appeal. These edits and remixes were rarely released to the public, and even then were available only on privately pressed vinyl records or on mixtapes.

The early house music sound was a ""dialogue"" between Hispanic,[2] and Black American post-disco[3][4][5] and European post-punk[6][7]electronic music and their traditions with Italo-disco picked or, emulated the most,[8] as the template for house music.[9] Precursors include electro songs ""Planet Rock,"" ""Let the Music Play,""[8] Italo-disco (e.g. Klein + M.B.O.), on one hand; EBM[9] (Liaisons Dangereuses;[10][11][12]Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft on acid house[11]) on another.

What we did was gather all the right ingredients.[8]

— Jesse Saunders

On the history, Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk says ""Jesse Saunders was first[.] He put out records before anyone conceived of doing it, got all the girls, and all the fame. Jesse wanted to be the next Motown.""[8]Screamin' Rachael, co-founder of Trax Records, describes the music the following way ""[w]hat Trax did was really a combination of punk and industrial with a really great 4x4 dance beat. Today they want to call it EDM, but Chicago house is the mother of them all. A lot of people don’t want to recognize—I think people in the UK do, but others don’t. Part of it is that Chicago was never an industry town, and New York always likes to claim they did it first.""[7] In 1984, Saunders' label released, on 12-inch single, a song called ""On and On"". Saunders composed the track with Vince Lawrence to replace a record that had been stolen from Saunders' collection, the ""On & On"" bootleg disco megamix by Mach. That megamix, a pastiche of loops from several electronic disco records, particularly the bassline from Player One's ""Space Invaders"" (1979), had been Saunders' ""signature"" tune as a DJ; it was one that other DJs in the city did not play. Saunders and Lawrence added hypnotic lyrics and electronic instruments, utilizing a Roland TR-808 drum machine as electronic percussion as well as a Korg Poly-61 synthesizer and a Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. In a 2010 interview, Saunders claimed the song sought to capture the essence of the style of disco that other local DJs were playing at the time, a style he says was already known locally as ""house"".[13][14]

Saunders' success with the relatively unpolished ""On & On"" inspired other Chicago DJs to try their hand at producing and releasing original songs in a similar style, using electronic instrumentation. Early such recordings included Jamie Principle's and Frankie Knuckles' ""Your Love"" (1986); and Chip E.'s ""Jack Trax"" record (1985), featuring the songs ""It's House"" and ""Time to Jack"", each of which used complex rhythms, simple bassline, sampling technology, and sparse vocals. These producers were aided in their efforts by the availability of affordable, mass-produced electronic music instruments, especially those from the Japanese Roland Corporation, including the TR-909,[15]TR-808 and TR-707 drum machines, TR-727 Latin percussion machine, Juno synthesizers,[16]TB-303 bass module, and compact sequencers.

Although there are conflicting accounts of the term's etymology, by 1985, ""house music"" was synonymous with these homegrown dance music productions.

As with other dance music, DJs and local club-goers were the primary audience for this relatively noncommercial music, which was more conceptual and longer than the music usually played on commercial radio. Mainstream record stores often did not carry it, as the records were not available through the major record distributors. In Chicago, only record stores such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, JR's Music shop and Gramaphone Records were the primary suppliers of this music. Despite the music's limited commercial availability, house records sold in the tens of thousands, and the music was further popularized via radio station 102.7 WBMX-FM, where Program Director Lee Michaels gave airtime to the station's resident DJ team, the Hot Mix 5 (Ralphi Rosario, Mickey ""Mixin"" Oliver, Scott ""Smokin"" Silz, Kenny ""Jammin"" Jason, and Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk). The Hot Mix 5 shows started with the station's launch in 1981, and was widely listened to by DJs and dance music fans in Chicago as well as visiting DJs and producers from Detroit.[17]

Many of the songs that defined the Chicago house music sound were released primarily on vinyl by the labels DJ International Records and Trax Records, both of which had distribution outside of Chicago, leading to house's popularity in other cities, including New York and London.

Trends in house music soon became subgenres, such as the lush, slower-tempo deep house, and the stark, especially hypnotic acid house. Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's jazzy, soulful recordings ""Mystery of Love"" (1985) and ""Can You Feel It?"" (1986),[18] which, according to author Richie Unterberger, moved house music away from its ""posthuman tendencies back towards the lush"" soulful sound of early disco music.[19]

Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's earliest release on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's ""Acid Tracks"" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan ""DJ Pierre"" Jones, Earl ""Spanky"" Smith Jr., and Herbert ""Herb J"" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context.[20] The group's 12-minute ""Acid Tracks"" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably.[21] The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine.

Chicago house music was being licensed to UK Labels by DJ International, Trax, KMS and the Transmat record labels, and with that the music began to expand throughout Europe. Especially the ""Jack Trax"" compilations, starting in 1987, helped to make rare house records from the U.S. available cheaply in Europe.

Several house tracks became #1 hits on the UK Singles Chart, starting with Chicago musician Steve ""Silk"" Hurley's ""Jack Your Body"" (1987). The first house record considered to be a major hit overseas is ""Love Can't Turn Around"" by Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk and Jesse Saunders featuring Darryl Pandy, which peaked at #10 in the UK Singles Chart in 1986.

At the same time as house was becoming big in Chicago, other related genres were forming in other major U.S cities.  Simon Reynolds' A Tale of Three Cities[22] (the first chapter of his book Energy Flash) looked at the emergence of techno in Detroit, house in Chicago, and garage in New York City and the reasons why the cultures took off like they did. Detroit was a unique urban area where industrial jobs had placed blacks and whites in the same economic situations, and this led to the Europhilia of these black youths and popularity of techno music. It was an attempt ""to distance themselves from the kids that were coming up in the projects, in the ghetto."" (Reynolds, p. 5)

Chicago house aesthetic shared its look with other outsider hip hop and punk subcultures; however, the ""indisputable sign of house-ness"" came to be a ""Ralph Lauren preppie meets English country gentleman style, with cardigans, woolen jodhpurs and riding boots.""[8]

When these house clubs and parties started to appeal to a wider audience, it was similar to the past disco culture in New York City.  Both genres originated catering to very specific subcultures and when the popularity grew it changed the whole scene.  The posting of 'no jits' signs was ""to make them feel unwanted. And that was when the scene started to self-destruct.""  However, even though there are definitely parallels between house and disco clubs, this seemed more like a reversal of roles. The more elitist house listeners did not want to dilute their clubs and culture.
Pages 230-248 of Brewster & Broughton's Last Night a DJ Saved My Life[8] also looked at the rise of the house scene in Chicago.  Through showing Frankie Knuckles club, it gave a look at the club scene that was taking place and the energetic, sweaty, drug-fueled parties that house embodied. ""House was a feeling, a rebellious musical taste, a way of declaring yourself in the know,"" (Broughton 242).

At least three styles of dancing are associated with house music: Jacking, Footwork, and Lofting.[citation needed] These styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles, including skating, stomping, and shuffle steps (also see Melbourne Shuffle).[citation needed] House music dancing styles can include movements from many other forms of dance, such as and slamdancing,[8]waacking, voguing, African, Latin, Brazilian (including Capoeira), jazz dance, Lindy Hop, tap dance, modern dance.[citation needed] House dancing is concerned with the sensuality of the body and setting oneself free in ecstasy — without the worry of outside barriers.[12]

One of the primary elements in house dancing is ""the jack"" or ""jacking"" — a style created in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles such as ""Time to Jack"" by Chip E. from the ""Jack Trax"" EP (1985), ""Jack’n the House"" (1985) by Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk (1985) or ""Jack Your Body"" by Steve ""Silk"" Hurley (1986). It involves moving the torso forward and backward in a rippling motion matching to the beat of the music, as if a wave were passing through it. All footwork in house dancing is said to initiate from the way the jack moves the center of gravity through space.[12]

House, perhaps more than any other form of Black music, has birthed many offshoots and spread its sound far and wide. The prevalence of four on the floor beats in dance music is largely derived from house. It has influenced, in some capacity, Garage house, Jungle music, Eurodance, Electropop, Dubstep, and even certain elements of Alternative rock and Hip hop.[23] More direct offshoots of house (e.g. Acid house) are also notable for their own offshoots that extend the Chicago variant's family tree.

House also partakes in aspects of the musical traditions of other sounds. Most notable is the influence it takes from disco—genre progenitor Frankie Knuckles was himself a relocated New York Disco DJ. In many senses, house was a low-budget re-creation of disco, using synthesizers, sequencers, and samplers in the stead of orchestras and live performers. Disco also participated, to a less notable extent, in the soundsystem culture of typically Caribbean forms of dance music.[23]

General:"
"Deep house","

Deep house is a subgenre of house music[1][3][4] that originated in the 1980s, initially fusing elements of Chicago house with the lush chords of 1980s jazz-funk and touches of soul music. Its origins are attributed to the early recordings of Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers), including his influential track ""Can You Feel It"".[5]

Deep house is known for tempos typically from 110 to 125 bpm,[1][6][7] muted basslines, spacious use of percussion elements (typically using a Roland TR-909 drum machine),[8] soft keyboard sounds (pads), use of advanced chord structures, ambient mixes, and soulful vocals.[citation needed]

Deep house was largely pioneered by Chicago producers such as Marshall Jefferson (On the House) and Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) and with tracks such as ""Mystery of Love"" (1985) and ""Can You Feel It?"" (1986);[9] the latter had a similar impact on deep house to that of Derrick May's ""Strings of Life"" (1987) on Detroit techno.[10] The jazzy sound became more common due to the favored use of gentler, more organic (yet still synthesizer based) production and instrument sounds. Author Richie Unterberger has stated that Heard's deep house sound moved house music away from its posthuman tendencies back towards the lush, soulful sound of early disco music (particularly that of old Philadelphia International and Salsoul records).[11] ""Can You Feel It"" became a deep house blueprint; Heard used a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer to create the deep bassline,[12] along with a Roland TR-909 drum machine for the beats.[8]

DJ Ron Trent stated that the term was initially used to describe the DJ work of Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, who departed from a strictly electronic house sound to incorporate eclectic elements like disco, jazz, and underground music.[13]

In the 2000s and 2010s, the genre remained very popular. By around mid/late 2010s, however, the perception of the genre was resulting in a sense that some house music was being labeled ""deep"" inappropriately,[14] and the term has since been used to encapsulate various types of bassline-driven house music, later named Brazilian bass or slap house, as the genre evolves from its historical origins.

For a list of deep house producers and disc jockeys, see: Deep house musicians.

Record labels of the genre include Alleviated Records (Larry Heard), Madhouse Records. Inc (Kerri Chandler),[15]  AFTR:HRS, Glasgow Underground, Naked Music, Om Records, Peacefrog Records, Soma, Source, Anjunadeep and Spinnin' Deep. Examples of deep house albums from artists known from other genres include The Martyr Mantras (1990) and Modernism: A New Decade (1989) from The Style Council."
"French house","

French house (also referred to as French touch, filter house, or tekfunk) is a style of house music devised by French musicians in the 1990s.[1] It is a form of Euro disco and a popular strand of the late 1990s and 2000s European EDM scene. The defining characteristics of the genre are filter and phaser effects both on and alongside samples from late 1970s and early 1980s European disco tracks. Tracks sometimes contained original hooks inspired by these samples, providing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre's forerunners.[2] Most tracks in this style are in 44 time and feature steady four-on-the-floor beats in the tempo range of 110–130 beats per minute. French house is similar to future funk, although there are some key differences. Purveyors of French house include Daft Punk,[3]David Guetta, Bob Sinclar, Martin Solveig, Cassius, The Supermen Lovers,[4]Modjo, Justice, Air, and Étienne de Crécy.

French house was influenced by American dance music, Euro disco, and the space disco music styles.[5] Space disco was popular in France during the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially with artists such as Cerrone and Sheila and B. Devotion. American P-Funk also influenced the genre's sound, especially the work of George Clinton and Bootsy Collins.[6] P-Funk was played alongside disco in many French discothèques, notably after Disco Demolition Night took place in the United States.[6] The Jacking aspect of Chicago house was also incorporated into the French house scene with ""jack house"" becoming a short-lived descriptive term for the sound in the UK. The influence of 1970s French pop music, championed by musicians such as François de Roubaix, Jean-Michel Jarre, and Serge Gainsbourg, is also apparent within the genre.[6]

Thomas Bangalter's tracks for his Roulé label were some of the earliest examples of French house. His solo material, along with his work as a member of Daft Punk and Stardust, influenced the French house scene during the mid-to-late 1990s.[7] The French duo Motorbass were among the first in France to produce house tracks largely based around samples and filtered loops and released their seminal album, Pansoul in 1996. Parisian producer St. Germain also produced jazz-inspired house tracks. Other known French producers during this time period, such as François Kevorkian and Laurent Garnier, remained distant from the emerging French house label.

UK dance music and European DJs first recognized French house experiments in the mid-1990s with commercial success occurring in 1997.[8]Daft Punk, Cassius and later Stardust were the first internationally successful artists of the genre, and along with Air, signed to Virgin Records. Initial releases by all three garnered music videos directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Alex & Martin. Thanks to a growing awareness of the clubbing scene, along with major label support, Daft Punk's debut album Homework entered the top 10 of the UK album charts upon its release. The duo would ultimately become the biggest-selling French act in the UK since Jean-Michel Jarre.[9] The emergence of the French sound coincided with dance music's popularity in the UK market, which was also experiencing a surge of interest in general electronic music.[10]

Further international commercial success continued into the 2000s with Bob Sinclar, Étienne de Crécy, Benjamin Diamond, and Modjo achieving hit singles in Europe. In late 2005, pop superstar Madonna released Confessions on a Dance Floor, an album with significant French house influences in several of its songs.[2]

The term ""French Touch"" was first used in Paris in July 1987.[11] Jean-Claude Lagrèze, a photographer of parisians' nights created a couple of ""French Touch"" parties at The Palace in an effort to help people discover house music. The parties were driven by DJ Laurent Garnier, Guillaume la Tortue and David Guetta. The expression ""We Give a French Touch to House"" was printed on a bomber jacket by Éric Morand for Fnac Music Dance Division in 1991.[10]

Prior to 1996, ""French house"" had been referred to among Europeans as ""nu-disco"", ""disco house"" and ""new disco"".[12] The term ""French touch"" was popularised by music journalist Martin James in the weekly music paper known as Melody Maker. He referred to the term in 1996 as a review of Étienne de Crécy's first album Super Discount. This term became favoured among the French media and was then widely used in the UK press by 1998.[8] The French newspaper, Libertation and Radio NRJ acknowledged Martin James as the coiner of the ""French Touch"".[citation needed] The term was then used on an MTV News special, to describe a ""French house explosion"" phenomenon. Bob Sinclar was interviewed, as well as Air (a non-house act) and Cassius. This news special later aired on all MTV local variations worldwide, spreading the term and introducing the ""French house"" sound to the mainstream population.[2]

Between 1998 and 2001, local music shop Discobole Records imported the records directly from France and middle class clubs dedicated totally to the genre, such as City Groove. In Greece, this music style was promoted as ""disco house"".[13] During 1999, many events also took place on Spain's Ibiza island, and has continued to be a very popular destination for British tourists.[14]

French house can be described as a combination of three production styles. One is what the French refer to as 'French house' or 'French Touch,' heavily influenced by the space disco sound. The second style is a continuation and update of Euro disco, drawing inspiration from the productions of Alec R. Costandinos. The third style embodies the deep American house influence, evident in the similar treatment of samples and repetitive 'funky' hooks. Further variations and mutations naturally followed.[citation needed]

French house initially maintained the established 'French Touch' sound, emphasizing Euro disco-like vocals and downplaying the 'space disco' themes. However, over time, most successful acts have evolved their sound. For instance, Bob Sinclar's later work, including the hit single 'World, Hold On (Children of the Sky),' exhibits only a distant connection to the original French house sound. Similarly, both Daft Punk and Étienne de Crécy developed a harder synthetic sound more directly inspired by techno, electro, and pop."
"Electro house","

Electro house is a genre of electronic dance music and a subgenre of house music characterized by heavy bass and a tempo around 125–135 beats per minute.[1] The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Benny Benassi, Skrillex, Steve Aoki, and Deadmau5.[2][3][4]

Simon Reynolds described electro house, as a style attributed to artists like Zedd, Erol Alkan and Bloody Beetroots.[5]
Electro-house is typified by its heavy bass.[6] This is often in the form of buzzing basslines,[6] such as those created with sawtooth waves and distortion.[7] It is also often in the form of large bass drum sounds[6] in a four-on-the-floor pattern.[7] The tempo of electro house is usually between 125 and 135 beats per minute.[1] Electro house sometimes resembles tech house,[8] but it can contain melodic elements[1] and electro-influenced samples and synths.[8] In contrast, Reynolds stated the genre had ""little relationship with either house or electro"".[5]

Reynolds described the sound as being influenced by Discovery by Daft Punk and further developed by Justice and Digitalism.[5] The sound was popularized in the United States by deadmau5 and noted the style's distinct style had a ""dirty bass"" with ""grinding and whirring sawtooth b-lines"".[5]

By 2011, the word ""electro"" had come to be seen as an adjective denoting ""hard electronic dance music"".[9]

Early songs that have been labelled retroactively as electro house include ""Dark Invader"" (1996) by Arrivers and ""Raw S*it"" (1997) by Basement Jaxx.[10]Mr. Oizo's ""Flat Beat"" (1999) has also been considered an early example of the genre.[11]

Andy Kellman of AllMusic described ""Satisfaction"" (2002) by Italian DJ Benny Benassi as being a precursor to electro-house.[12][13] By the mid 2000s, electro house saw an increase in popularity.[1] In November 2006, electro house tracks ""Put Your Hands Up For Detroit"" by Fedde Le Grand and the D. Ramirez remix of ""Yeah Yeah"" by Bodyrox and Luciana held the number one and number two spots, respectively, in the UK Top 40 singles charts.[14] Since then, electro house producers such as Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Porter Robinson, Yasutaka Nakata[15] and Dada Life have emerged.

In the early 2010s, a type of electro house known as big room began to develop, particularly gaining popularity through EDM-oriented events and festivals. Big room songs resemble Dutch house, often incorporating drops, minimalist percussion, regular beats, sub-bass layered kicks, simple melodies and synth-driven breakdowns.[16][17] The layout of a big room track is very similar to the layout of a typical electro house song.

Complextro is typified by glitchy, intricate basslines and textures created by sharply cutting between instruments in quick succession.[18][19] The term, a portmanteau of the words ""complex"" and ""electro"",[18][19][20] was coined by Porter Robinson to describe the music he was making in 2010.[20][21] He has cited video game sounds, or chiptunes, as an influence on his music along with 1980s analog synth music.[22] Other producers of the genre include Adventure Club, Kill the Noise,  Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Madeon,[18]Mord Fustang, Savant, Virtual Riot, Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner.

Dutch house, sometimes referred to as 'Dirty Dutch', is a style of electro house that originated in the Netherlands and found prominence by 2009,[23] mainly pioneered by Vato Gonzalez , Afrojack and DJ Chuckie. It is primarily defined by complex rhythms made from Latin-influenced drum kits, a lower emphasis on basslines and squeaky, high-pitched lead synths. Influences on the subgenre include Detroit techno, hip hop and other urban styles of music.[24]

Fidget house, or fidget, is ""defined by snatched vocal snippets, pitch-bent dirty basslines and rave-style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.""[25] It contains influences from Chicago house, Detroit techno, Baltimore club, Kuduro and hip hop.[25] Purveyors of the genre include The Bloody Beetroots, AC Slater, Danger, Hervé, Jack Beats and Switch. The term fidget house was coined by DJs/producers Jesse Rose and Switch, ""as a joke, which has now gone a little too far.""[25]

Melbourne bounce is a subgenre of electro house originating in Melbourne, Australia, characterized by the progression from the uptempo, horn-infused Dutch house style, tech trance synths, electro house stabs, and scouse house-influenced bass lines,[26] sometimes also including elements of acid house, psytrance.[27] The genre is generally characterized by a standard 128 bpm, although in some cases up to 150 bpm.[clarification needed] The term has been used[by whom?] to describe the 2012 to 2016 music of some DJ/producers, including Deorro, Joel Fletcher, Will Sparks, Vinai, and TJR. It is composed of bouncy offbeat bass, whiny vocal cut/saw[clarification needed] lead, raucous horns, 8-bar snare fills before the drop.[28] It often features a repetitive beat structure with some amount of build-ups and mild drops throughout. It started as a cross between elements, and underground Melbourne house/minimal style. Melbourne Bounce gained popularity around mid to late 2012 and had a steady rise from 2013. In 2014, productions of Joel Fletcher, Will Sparks, and Uberjak'd were playing both domestically and internationally, and influencing the EDM style of Steve Aoki, TJR, and more.[29]

Jungle terror is a music genre that developed in the 2010s. It is often described as a ""chaotic"" mix of house with grime and drum 'n' bass rhythms.[30] There are also animal noises as well as vocal cuts and percussions. The Dutch DJ and music producer Wiwek is named[by whom?] as the founder of the genre,[31] who made the style popular in the EDM scene between 2013 and 2016. Skrillex, Diplo and KURA are also associated with the genre.

Moombahton came as a mixture of slowed-down Dutch house and reggaeton.[32] Its identifying characteristics include ""a thick, spread-out bass line; some dramatic builds; and a two-step pulse, with quick drum fills"",[33] but it has ""no real rules beyond working within a 108 bpm range.""[34] A portmanteau of ""moombah"" and ""reggaeton"", moombahton was created by DJ Dave Nada when he slowed down the tempo of the Afrojack remix of the Silvio Ecomo & Chuckie song ""Moombah"" to please party-goers with tastes in reggaeton.[33] Other producers of the genre include Dillon Francis, Diplo and Munchi.[34]

Moombahcore is a style of moombahton with elements of breakcore, dubstep, techstep and newstyle hardcore.[35][36] Characteristics of the genre include chopped vocals, dubstep-influenced bass sounds and extensive build-ups.[36] Artists who have produced moombahcore include Delta Heavy, Dillon Francis, Feed Me, Knife Party, and Noisia."
"Electro house","

Electro house is a genre of electronic dance music and a subgenre of house music characterized by heavy bass and a tempo around 125–135 beats per minute.[1] The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Benny Benassi, Skrillex, Steve Aoki, and Deadmau5.[2][3][4]

Simon Reynolds described electro house, as a style attributed to artists like Zedd, Erol Alkan and Bloody Beetroots.[5]
Electro-house is typified by its heavy bass.[6] This is often in the form of buzzing basslines,[6] such as those created with sawtooth waves and distortion.[7] It is also often in the form of large bass drum sounds[6] in a four-on-the-floor pattern.[7] The tempo of electro house is usually between 125 and 135 beats per minute.[1] Electro house sometimes resembles tech house,[8] but it can contain melodic elements[1] and electro-influenced samples and synths.[8] In contrast, Reynolds stated the genre had ""little relationship with either house or electro"".[5]

Reynolds described the sound as being influenced by Discovery by Daft Punk and further developed by Justice and Digitalism.[5] The sound was popularized in the United States by deadmau5 and noted the style's distinct style had a ""dirty bass"" with ""grinding and whirring sawtooth b-lines"".[5]

By 2011, the word ""electro"" had come to be seen as an adjective denoting ""hard electronic dance music"".[9]

Early songs that have been labelled retroactively as electro house include ""Dark Invader"" (1996) by Arrivers and ""Raw S*it"" (1997) by Basement Jaxx.[10]Mr. Oizo's ""Flat Beat"" (1999) has also been considered an early example of the genre.[11]

Andy Kellman of AllMusic described ""Satisfaction"" (2002) by Italian DJ Benny Benassi as being a precursor to electro-house.[12][13] By the mid 2000s, electro house saw an increase in popularity.[1] In November 2006, electro house tracks ""Put Your Hands Up For Detroit"" by Fedde Le Grand and the D. Ramirez remix of ""Yeah Yeah"" by Bodyrox and Luciana held the number one and number two spots, respectively, in the UK Top 40 singles charts.[14] Since then, electro house producers such as Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Porter Robinson, Yasutaka Nakata[15] and Dada Life have emerged.

In the early 2010s, a type of electro house known as big room began to develop, particularly gaining popularity through EDM-oriented events and festivals. Big room songs resemble Dutch house, often incorporating drops, minimalist percussion, regular beats, sub-bass layered kicks, simple melodies and synth-driven breakdowns.[16][17] The layout of a big room track is very similar to the layout of a typical electro house song.

Complextro is typified by glitchy, intricate basslines and textures created by sharply cutting between instruments in quick succession.[18][19] The term, a portmanteau of the words ""complex"" and ""electro"",[18][19][20] was coined by Porter Robinson to describe the music he was making in 2010.[20][21] He has cited video game sounds, or chiptunes, as an influence on his music along with 1980s analog synth music.[22] Other producers of the genre include Adventure Club, Kill the Noise,  Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Madeon,[18]Mord Fustang, Savant, Virtual Riot, Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner.

Dutch house, sometimes referred to as 'Dirty Dutch', is a style of electro house that originated in the Netherlands and found prominence by 2009,[23] mainly pioneered by Vato Gonzalez , Afrojack and DJ Chuckie. It is primarily defined by complex rhythms made from Latin-influenced drum kits, a lower emphasis on basslines and squeaky, high-pitched lead synths. Influences on the subgenre include Detroit techno, hip hop and other urban styles of music.[24]

Fidget house, or fidget, is ""defined by snatched vocal snippets, pitch-bent dirty basslines and rave-style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.""[25] It contains influences from Chicago house, Detroit techno, Baltimore club, Kuduro and hip hop.[25] Purveyors of the genre include The Bloody Beetroots, AC Slater, Danger, Hervé, Jack Beats and Switch. The term fidget house was coined by DJs/producers Jesse Rose and Switch, ""as a joke, which has now gone a little too far.""[25]

Melbourne bounce is a subgenre of electro house originating in Melbourne, Australia, characterized by the progression from the uptempo, horn-infused Dutch house style, tech trance synths, electro house stabs, and scouse house-influenced bass lines,[26] sometimes also including elements of acid house, psytrance.[27] The genre is generally characterized by a standard 128 bpm, although in some cases up to 150 bpm.[clarification needed] The term has been used[by whom?] to describe the 2012 to 2016 music of some DJ/producers, including Deorro, Joel Fletcher, Will Sparks, Vinai, and TJR. It is composed of bouncy offbeat bass, whiny vocal cut/saw[clarification needed] lead, raucous horns, 8-bar snare fills before the drop.[28] It often features a repetitive beat structure with some amount of build-ups and mild drops throughout. It started as a cross between elements, and underground Melbourne house/minimal style. Melbourne Bounce gained popularity around mid to late 2012 and had a steady rise from 2013. In 2014, productions of Joel Fletcher, Will Sparks, and Uberjak'd were playing both domestically and internationally, and influencing the EDM style of Steve Aoki, TJR, and more.[29]

"Future house","Future house is a house music genre that emerged in the 2010s in the United Kingdom, described as a fusion of deep house,[5]UK garage[1][2] and incorporating other elements and techniques of other EDM genres.[6] It is high in energy, generally consisting of big drops, 4/4 beats and is sonically bass heavy.

The term ""future house"" was coined by French DJ Tchami[7][8] and was first used to categorise his 2013 remix of Janet Jackson's ""Go Deep"" on SoundCloud.[9] Tchami used the term without considering it a genre saying in a 2015 interview ""Future house was meant to be 'any kind of house music that hasn't been invented yet,' so I never considered it as a genre. I guess people made it what it is because my music was specific and leading to build a bridge between house and EDM, which isn't a bad thing"".[10] Later, in 2016, the popular online music store for DJs Beatport added Future house as one of three new genre tags.[11] The genre has been credited as also being pioneered by Oliver Heldens and Don Diablo.[12]

Future house is a subgenre of house music. Songs within the genre are normally characterized by a muted melody with a metallic, elastic-sounding[13]drop and frequency-modulated basslines.[14] The most common tempo is 126 and 128 BPM, but it can vary around the 120–130 mark.

Oliver Heldens' international chart successes ""Gecko (Overdrive)"" and ""Last All Night (Koala)"" brought the genre to wider mainstream recognition in 2014, leading to minor feuds between him and Tchami on social media.[15] Artists such as Martin Solveig, GTA and Liam Payne have since incorporated the sound into their work, leading some commentators to observe the commercialization of the style.[14]

"Hip house","Hip house, also known as rap house or house rap, is a musical genre that mixes elements of house music and hip hop music, that originated in both London, United Kingdom and Chicago, United States in the mid to late 1980s.[1]

British group the Beatmasters' ""Rok da House"" is known to be the first hip house record,[2] having been written and pressed to vinyl in August 1986.[citation needed] Other early hip house records by British artists include ""Pump Up the Volume"" by MARRS and ""Beat Dis"" by Bomb the Bass, both from 1987.

Minor controversy ensued in 1988 when a U.S. record called ""Turn Up the Bass"" by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the ""first hip house record on vinyl"". The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that ""Rok da House"" had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released ""Who's in the House?"" featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines ""Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention"" and ""Watch out Tyree, we come faster"". More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down by Fast Eddie in ""Yo Yo Get Funky!"", Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock with ""It Takes Two"", and Tony Scott's ""That's How I'm Living"".

After successful releases by the Beatmasters, Deskee, Tyree, KC Flightt, Doug Lazy and Mr. Lee, hip-house became popular in the acid house warehouse scene and nightclubs. Hip house also garnered substantial chart success.[3] The style complemented sample-based records of the period, produced by British artists such as S-Express, Bomb the Bass and M|A|R|R|S.

Hip house's further crossover success would come in the form of two ground breaking records: ""I'll House You"" by the Jungle Brothers and ""It Takes Two"" by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock. ""I'll House You"" is generally seen as a collaboration between New York City house-music producer Todd Terry and the Jungle Brothers (an Afrocentric hip-hop group from New York). ""It Takes Two"" was described by Hip Hop Connection magazine as ""...the first palatable form of hip-house for hardcore hip hop fans.""[citation needed]

Hip hop rappers that would receive the hip house remix treatment included Vitamin C, Sweet Tee, Raze, and the D.O.C.

Hip house tracks featured on popular dance compilations including Telstar's Deep Heat compilation series and was championed by DJs such as To Kool Chris and Chad Jackson.

As house music emerged as a worldwide industry by the late 1980s, U.S. acts such as C+C Music Factory would use the hip house formula in hits such as ""Gonna Make You Sweat"", as well as the Eurodance genre — particularly with hits by the Belgian group Technotronic, German groups Snap! and Real McCoy, and Italian Lee Marrow.

Late 1980s hip house releases by UK artists such as Double Trouble and Rebel MC, Blapps Posse and Shut Up and Dance were an early influence towards the early 1990s UK rave scene and the breakbeat hardcore genre (and genres that developed from it such as jungle).[4][5]

A modern form of hip house became popular in the mid-2000s, known as electro hop,[6] with artists enjoying mainstream success towards the end of the decade and into the 2010s. These artists included LMFAO,[7][8]Pitbull (most notably with his albums Rebelution (2009)[9] and Planet Pit (2011)),[10][11]Flo Rida,[12][13]Far East Movement,[14][15][16][17]Hyper Crush,[18]Example (described as ""rave-rap"" or ""rave-hop"") and Azealia Banks.[19]Electronic dance music DJs/producers also had hits in the genre, which featured vocals from rappers. These include ""C'mon (Catch 'em by Surprise)"" by Tiësto and Diplo with Busta Rhymes,[6] and ""Forever"" by Wolfgang Gartner and will.i.am. French DJ David Guetta had several hip house hits such as ""Memories"" with Kid Cudi,[6] ""Where Them Girls At"" with Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj,[20] ""Gettin' Over You"" with LMFAO and ""Little Bad Girl"" with Taio Cruz and Ludacris.[6]

Hip house in the 2020s include ""Boss Bitch"" by Doja Cat, ""Ego Death"" by Ty Dolla Sign, ""My High"" by Disclosure, Aminé and Slowthai, ""Believe What I Say"" by Kanye West, ""Her"" by Megan Thee Stallion and ""Thique"" by Beyoncé."
"Moombahton","Moombahton (/ˈmuːmbətɒn/, MOOM-bə-ton) is an electronic dance music genre, derived from house music and reggaeton, that was created by American DJ and producer Dave Nada in Washington, D.C., in 2009.[2][3] Nada coined the name as a portmanteau of ""Moombah"" (a track by Surinamese house DJ Chuckie and Dutch producer/DJ Silvio Ecomo) and reggaeton (itself a neologism combining reggae with the Spanish suffix -ton, signifying big).

Identifying characteristics of moombahton include a thick and spread-out bass line, dramatic builds, and a two-step pulse with quick drum fills. Occasionally moombahton includes rave music synthesizers and a cappella rap samples.[2] Musically, moombahton mixes the rhythmic origins of Dutch house or house music, the slow tempo of reggaeton, usually between 100-110bpm, accompanied by bouncy percussions from reggaeton.[2]

Moombahton was created by Dave Nada in late 2009 while DJing his cousin's high school cut party in Washington, D.C. He blended the house and club music which he had planned to play with the reggaeton and bachata the guests were previously listening to by slowing down Afrojack's remix of Silvio Ecomo and Chuckie's song ""Moombah!"" from 128 bpm to 108 bpm, to create the basis of the genre.[5].mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}

... I tried to slow down my house songs, I put the Afrojack remix of ""Moombah"" by Silvio Ecomo and DJ Chuckie at 108 bpm, and the people went crazy. I did the same with Sidney Samson's ""Riverside"", and it was a delirium. I understood that I would have to record these editions as soon as possible

Between late 2009 and early 2010, Nada worked on a five track extended play of moombahton that was released in March 2010, with the support of the DJ Ayres and the DJ Tittsworth at T&A Records.[7]

Moombahcore is a derivation of moombahton with dubstep influences, also incorporating elements of newstyle hardcore, breakcore, and techstep.[4] Moombahcore fused dubstep drums and moombahton tempo (100-115 BPM), incorporating elements such as wobble bass, FM synths, distorted basslines, and complex percussion patterns.[8]

Moombahsoul is a subgenre of moombahton with deep house influences. It combines the elements of soul, lofi, deep house and chill with moombahton backed drums and textures. David Heartbreak put together one of the genres first compilations in 2011 entitled 'HEARTBREAK presents MOOMBAHSOUL'.[9] The 15 track compilation included tracks by Munchi, Heartbreak, DJ Theory & More."
"Progressive house","

Progressive house is a subgenre of house music. The progressive house style emerged in the early 1990s. It initially developed in the United Kingdom as a natural progression of North American and European house music of the late 1980s.[1][2]

In the context of popular music the word ""progressive"" was first used widely in the 1970s to differentiate experimental forms of rock music from mainstream styles. Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production.[3] Some acts also attempted to elevate the aesthetic values of rock music by incorporating features associated with classical instrumental music. This led to a style of music called progressive rock, which has been described as ""the most self-consciously arty branch of rock.""[4]

In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word ""progressive"" to make a distinction.[citation needed] According to the DJ and producer Carl Craig, the term ""progressive"" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italo disco.[5] The music was dubbed ""progressive"" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic sound of Philadelphia soul.[5] In Detroit, prior to the emergence of techno, artists like Alexander Robotnick, Klein + M.B.O. and Capricorn filled a vacancy left after disco's demise in America.[5][6] In the late 1980s, UK music journalist Simon Reynolds introduced the term ""progressive dance"" to describe acts such as 808 State, The Orb, Bomb the Bass and The Shamen. Between 1990 and 1992, the term ""progressive"" referred to the short-form buzz word for the house music subgenre ""progressive house"".[7]

Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music.[8] The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom.[9] In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a ""new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.""[7] A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, Polish house, German house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era.[7] The term was used mainly as a marketing label to differentiate new rave house from traditional American house.[7] Progressive house was a departure from the Chicago acid house sound.[8] The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots.[7] Progressive house was viewed by some as anti-rave as its popularity rose in English clubs while breakbeat hardcore flourished at raves.[10] According to DJ Dave Seaman, the sound faced a backlash in the early 1990s because ""it had gone the same way as progressive rock before it. Pompous, po-faced and full of its own self importance. But basically was really quite boring.""[9] The label progressive house was often used interchangeably with trance in the early years.[7] The record label Bedrock Records released a series of ""Bedrock’s ‘Compiled and Mixed’"" albums featuring artists like Chris Fortier, John Creamer & Stephane K.[11][12] Australian artist, Luke Chable has been known for his 2003 seminal remix release PQM’s ""You Are Sleeping"", titled ""You Are Sleeping (Luke Chable Vocal Pass)"".[13][14]

AllMusic says that progressive house ""led the increasingly mainstream-sounding house from the charts back to the dance floors"".[15]

According to American DJ/producer duo Gabriel & Dresden, Leftfield's October 1990 release ""Not Forgotten"" was possibly the first progressive house production.[16] The record label Guerilla Records, set up by William Orbit & Dick O'Dell, is thought to have been pivotal in the growth of a scene around the genre.[16]Renaissance: The Mix Collection in 1994 and Northern Exposure in 1996 have both been credited with establishing the genre on mixed compilation albums. As well as Guerilla Records, the labels Deconstruction Records, Hooj Choons and Soma Records contributed to the scene's development in the early to mid-1990s.[9]

In June 1992, Mixmag published a list that contained what the magazine viewed as the top progressive house tracks at that time.[7]



According to Dave Seaman, house DJs who had originally played what was known as Eurodance borrowed from that genre.[9] This led to a commercial sound that people associate with progressive house today.[9] Seaman notes that with the various lines between genres having become so blurred that true progressive house is often found ""masquerading"" as techno, tech house or even deep house.[9] As such, the music can feature elements derived from styles such as dub, deep house and Italo house.[17]

The progressive sound can be distinct from the later uplifting trance and vocal trance. It tends to lack anthemic choruses, crescendos and drum rolling,[17] but holds an emphasis on rhythmic layers.[9] Intensity is added by the regular addition and subtraction of layers of sound.[18]Phrases are typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and often begin with a new or different melody or rhythm.[19]

Later progressive house tunes often featured a build-up section which can last up to four minutes.  This is followed by a breakdown and then a climax.[19] ""Strobe"" by Deadmau5 is a good example, which had been cited by Billboard Dance as the artist's all-time best song and one of the reasons for EDM's resurgence in the 2010s mainstream.[20][21][22][23] Elements drawn from the progressive rock genre include the use of extended or linked-movement tracks, more complexity and reflection but almost always within the four on the floor rhythm pattern.[24]"
"Tropical house","Tropical house, also known as trop house,[1] is a subgenre of house music, and a derivation of tropical music,[2][3] with elements of dancehall and Balearic house.[4] Artists of the genre are often featured at various summer festivals such as Tomorrowland.[5] The genre was popularized by artists including Thomas Jack, Klangkarussell, Kygo, Klingande, Robin Schulz, Bakermat, Matoma, Lost Frequencies, Felix Jaehn, Seeb and Gryffin.[6] Tropical house hits include Kygo's ""Firestone"", Klingande's ""Jubel"", Felix Jaehn's remix of ""Cheerleader"", Robin Schulz's remixes of ""Waves"" and ""Prayer in C"", and Lost Frequencies's remix of ""Are You With Me"".

The term ""Tropical House"" began as a joke by Australian producer Thomas Jack, but has since gone on to gain popularity among listeners.[2][7] The term ""trouse"" should not be confused with tropical house, as ""trouse"" is a genre that instead combines the feeling of trance and the beats of progressive house, using electro synths.[8]

Tropical house is a derivation of deep house music characterized by its relaxed and island-inspired melodies which give off a ""Caribbean, beach-party vibe.”[1] Like deep house, it features synthesized instrumentation and a four-on-the-floor beat at a tempo of 100 to 120 bpm, slower than average electronic music.[1][9] The subgenre distinguishes itself through its use of airy synths, melodic rhythms, and tropical instruments, such as steel percussions, trumpets, saxophones, flutes, marimbas, or bongos.[10] Tropical house does not make use of the build-ups and drops seen in EDM, instead featuring calming melodies and soft vocals that are easy to listen to in any setting.[1][11] It aims to create a laid-back atmosphere evoking the paradisical imagery of an island holiday, typically associated with the tropics.[10] Producers frequently follow up the vocal delivery of the hook with an instrumental break highlighting the melody. Lyrically, songs often talk about happiness, love, relationships, break-ups, and sadness.

While EDM happens mainly in clubs, tropical house is more associated with online platforms as well as outdoor festivals, beach parties and boat raves. Successful producers typically break through on SoundCloud or YouTube where their remixes of mainstream tracks in the tropical style can gather tens of millions of views before they are signed to a commercial label and start producing original singles in the genre.[10]

In the mid and late 2000s, Bob Sinclar and Yves Larock created international hits which had many characteristics of tropical house, drawing inspiration from 1980's Hi-NRG music and in contrast with other sub-types of Electronic (""EDM"") music of the time. The style was further popularized by Stereo Love, an international hit by Edward Maya, a music producer from the Romanian house scene.[7] In 2012, Unicorn Kid had created tropical rave, a faster form of the genre which would become known as tropical house. However, it was not until 2013 with Klangkarussell's ""Sun Don't Shine"" and the emergence of producers such as Kygo and Robin Schulz that tropical house became a dance music trend. During 2014 and 2015, producers such as Lost Frequencies, Felix Jaehn, Alex Adair, Sam Feldt, Bakermat, Klingande, Jonas Blue and Faul & Wad Ad would join them with big tropical house hits.[1][12] During the mid-2010s, certain tropical house producers would team up with artists such as Justin Bieber and Little Mix. This helped the genre achieve massive commercial success and gave rise to the playlist term of 'tropical pop',[13][14] this success best articulated through the tropical pop hit ""Shape of You"" by Ed Sheeran,[15] which to this day is the second highest streamed song on Spotify.[16]"
"Industrial metal","Industrial metal is the fusion of heavy metal and industrial music, typically employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals.[1] Prominent industrial metal acts include Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, KMFDM, and Godflesh.[3][4]
Industrial metal developed in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre.[3] Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America,[5] with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails, but its popularity began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.[6]"
"Industrial rock","

Industrial rock is a fusion genre that fuses industrial music and rock music. It initially originated in the 1970s, and drew influence from early experimental and industrial acts such as Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten and Chrome. Industrial rock became more prominent in the 1980s with the success of artists such as Killing Joke, Swans, and partially Skinny Puppy, and later spawned the offshoot genre known as industrial metal. The genre was made more accessible to mainstream audiences in the 1990s with the aid of acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, both of which have released platinum-selling records.

Richie Unterberger assessed the Red Krayola as ""a precursor to industrial rock""[1] with their 1967 record The Parable of Arable Land exhibiting music made by 50 people on anything from industrial power tools to a revving motorcycle whilst Pitchfork's Alex Lindhart cited their 1968 follow up God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It as being ""bootleg Einstürzende Neubauten at its grimiest atonality"". AllMusic critic Alex Henderson has stated that experimental group Cromagnon's 1969 record Orgasm foreshadowed the industrial rock sound.[2] Specifically, Pitchfork's Zach Baron noted their song ""Caledonia"" for its ""pre-industrial stomp"".[3]Krautrock musicians Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger included industrial noise on their track ""Negativland"" (from their 1972 debut Neu!) as well as krautrock band Faust on their track ""Meadow Meal"" (from their 1971 debut Faust). AllMusic stated that Suicide's 1977 debut album ""provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.""[4]

In 1976, English musician David Bowie collaborated with American musician Iggy Pop on his 1977 solo debut The Idiot.[5] Musically, the album is said to contain elements of industrial rock,[6] notably the closing track, ""Mass Production"", which contains numerous ""proto-industrial noises"" created using tape loops,[7] and is described by Hugo Wilcken as ""early industrial electronica"".[8]The Idiot has been described as having a major influence on Joy Division, who formed shortly before its release.[9] Joy Division were signed to the industrially themed label Factory Records which had been founded in 1978; their albums Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980) heavily influenced the further development of industrial rock. Chrome has also been credited as the ""beginning of industrial rock""[10] and their 1978 Half Machine Lip Moves was listed on Wire's ""100 Records That Set The World On Fire (When No One Was Listening)"".[11]

Industrial rock was created in the mid- to late 1970s, amidst the punk rock revolution and disco fever.  Prominent early industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, NON, SPK and Z'EV.[12] Many other artists have been cited as influences such as Kraftwerk, Gary Numan, and Tubeway Army as well as Einstürzende Neubauten and Fad Gadget. Many other musical performers were incorporating industrial music elements into a variety of musical styles.

Some post-punk performers developed styles parallel to industrial music's defining attributes. Pere Ubu's debut, The Modern Dance, was described by Jim Irvin as ""industrial"",[13] and Chris Connelly said the musical project Foetus was ""the instigator when it comes to the marriage of machinery to hardcore punk.""[14] Music journalist Simon Reynolds considered Killing Joke, which saw mainstream success with their 1985 album Night Time,[15] ""a post-punk version of heavy metal.""[16]

Others followed in their wake.[17] The New York City band Swans were inspired by the local no wave scene, as well as punk rock, noise music (particularly Whitehouse) and the original industrial groups.[18]Steve Albini's Big Black followed a similar path,[19] while also incorporating American hardcore punk.[20] Big Black has also been closely associated with post-hardcore and noise rock, though their ties to industrial music are extremely apparent. The Swiss trio The Young Gods, who deliberately eschewed electric guitars in favor of a sampler,[21] also took inspiration from both hardcore and industrial.[22] In 1986, Canadian band Skinny Puppy released the album Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse,[23] with its lead single, ""Dig It"", seeing frequent airplay on MTV.[24] The song was a major influence on Nine Inch Nails founder Trent Reznor, who used it as inspiration when writing his first song, ""Down in It"".[25]: 38

Chicago's Wax Trax! Records became a vanguard for the genre in the 1980s[26] and is credited for introducing it to the United States.[27]Ministry's 1988 album The Land of Rape and Honey, departed from the band's synthesizer-oriented sound for a rock style that drew from hardcore punk and thrash metal, while retaining electronic elements and samples.[28][29] Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen was also involved in multiple industrial rock side projects that were signed to Wax Trax!, including Revolting Cocks, 1000 Homo DJs and Pailhead.[30] Drawing heavy influences from the New York's no wave scene, Cop Shoot Cop incorporated two bass guitars with no guitars.[31]

In the 1990s, industrial rock broke into the mainstream with artists and bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Orgy, Rob Zombie, White Zombie, and Marilyn Manson. In December 1992, Nine Inch Nails' EP Broken was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[32] Nine Inch Nails gained further popularity with the release of their 1994 album The Downward Spiral, which was certified 4× platinum by the RIAA in 1998.[33] The band's 1999 album The Fragile was certified 2× platinum in January 2000.[34] With the success of Nine Inch Nails, the band's debut album Pretty Hate Machine was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA.[35] In the 1990s, four Nine Inch Nails songs went on the Billboard Hot 100.[36] Several industrial rock and industrial metal artists such as KMFDM, Fear Factory, Gravity Kills and Sister Machine Gun appeared on the 1995 Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,[37] which was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1996.[38]

Marilyn Manson released their album Antichrist Superstar in 1996, which was certified platinum by the RIAA two months after its release date.[39] In the United States, Antichrist Superstar sold at least 1,900,000 units.[40] Marilyn Manson's EP Smells Like Children was certified platinum in May 1998.[41] The band's third album Mechanical Animals went to number 1, dethroning Lauryn Hill's solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and selling 223,000 copies in its first week in stores.[42] It was certified platinum by the RIAA in February 1999[43] and sold at least 1,409,000 copies in the United States.[44]Orgy also experienced mainstream success during the 1990s. The band's 1998 album Candyass was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 1999.[45] Orgy's cover of New Order's song ""Blue Monday"" went to number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100[46] and number 2 on the Dance Club Songs chart.[47] White Zombie experimented with industrial metal on its 1995 album Astro-Creep: 2000,[48] which was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in March 1996.[49] White Zombie's vocalist Rob Zombie began creating pure industrial metal albums in his solo career. Rob Zombie's 1998 solo debut studio album Hellbilly Deluxe was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA less than two years after its release date.[50] In November 1999, Powerman 5000's album Tonight the Stars Revolt! was certified platinum by the RIAA.[51] The album sold at least 1,316,172 units in the United States.[52]
A large Industrial metal scene also emerged in Europe in the 20th century. The Industrial Metal band that manages to appeal to the largest audiences worldwide is Rammstein.
Other names have also proven successful in the European scene, including Pain, Deathstars, Dagoba, Eisbrecher, Gothminister and Godflesh."
"Neo soul","Neo soul (sometimes called progressive soul)[1] is a genre of popular music. As a term, it was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from funk, jazz fusion, hip hop, and African music to pop, rock, and electronic music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.
Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, in the United States and United Kingdom, as a soul revival movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists, including D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&B of the time, although many of them were ambivalent about the term.
Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&B, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists. Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s, although newer artists emerged through more independent means of marketing their music. In his book The Essential Neo Soul (2010), music journalist and culture critic Chris Campbell writes that, while the genre has been woefully misunderstood and its artists mis-marketed, there is a historical and social relevance that validates its designation as the current face of alternative progressive soul music (in both underground and overground circles), complete with a distinct origin and developmental evolution.[2] According to Mark Anthony Neal, neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop.[3]
Despite some ambivalence from artists, the term received widespread use by music critics and writers who wrote about artists and albums associated with the musical style.[7][1] African American studies professor Mark Anthony Neal has described neo soul as everything from avant-garde R&B to organic soul ... a product of trying to develop something outside of the norm in R&B.[10] According to music writers, the genre's works are mostly album-oriented and distinguished by its musicianship and production, incorporating organic elements of classic soul music with the use of live instrumentation, in contrast to the more single-oriented, hip hop-based, and producer-driven sampling approach of contemporary R&B.[7][11][12] Neo soul also incorporates elements of electronic music,[13] jazz fusion, funk, rap, gospel, rock, reggae, and African music.[14] In her book Musical Rhythm in the Age of Digital Reproduction, music author Anne Danielsen wrote that neo soul toward the end of the 1990s exhibited a musical development that was part of a remarkable increase in musicians' experimentation with and manipulation of grooves at the microrhythmic level – that is, the level in played music that is usually understood in terms of phrasing and timing.[15]
Common (shown in 2003) wore knit caps fashioned in the style of Marvin Gaye.[16]
Noting that most of the genre's artists are singer-songwriters, writers have viewed their lyrical content as more conscious-driven and having a broader range than most other R&B artists.[4][7][12] AllMusic calls it roughly analogous to contemporary R&B.[17] Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe said that they emphasize a mix of elegant, jazz-tinged R&B and subdued hip hop, with a highly idiosyncratic, deeply personal approach to love and politics.[4] Music writers have noted that neo soul artists are predominantly female, which contrasts the marginalized presence of women in mainstream hip hop and R&B.[18] Jason Anderson of CBC News called neo soul a sinuous, sly yet unabashedly earnest alternative and kind of haven for listeners turned off by the hedonism of mainstream hip-hop and club jams.[9] Neo soul artists are often associated with alternative lifestyles and fashions, including organic food, incense, and knit caps.[19]
According to music writer Peter Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from older R&B styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R&B counterparts.[5] In a 1998 article on neo soul, Time journalist Christopher John Farley wrote that singers such as Hill, D'Angelo, and Maxwell share a willingness to challenge musical orthodoxy.[12] Miles Marshall Lewis commented that 1990s neo soul owed its raison d'être to '70s soul superstars like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, adding that in concert, Erykah Badu and D'Angelo regularly covered Chaka Khan, the Ohio Players, and Al Green, to make the lineage crystal clear.[20] In citing Tony! Toni! Toné! as progenitors of the genre, Tony Green of Vibe viewed that the group pioneered the digital-analog hybrid sound of neo soul and dramatically refreshed the digitalized wasteland that was R&B in the late '80s.[21] Neo soul artists during the 1990s were heavily inspired by the eclectic sound and mellow instrumentation of Gil Scott-Heron's and Brian Jackson's collaborative work in the 1970s.[22] All About Jazz cited Jackson as one of the early architects of the sound and his early work with Scott-Heron as an inspirational and musical Rosetta stone for the neo-soul movement.[23]"
"Dubstep","Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the early 2000s. The style emerged as a UK garage offshoot[1] that blended 2-step rhythms and sparse dub production, as well as incorporating elements of broken beat, grime, and drum and bass.[2] In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s.[2][3]
Dubstep is generally characterised by the use of syncopated rhythmic patterns, with prominent basslines, and a dark tone. In 2001, this underground sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the Forward night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the pirate radio station Rinse FM, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term dubstep in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.[4]
A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician in their top 50 for the year.[5] Dubstep started to enter mainstream British popular culture when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz.[6] Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled Dubstep Warz) in January 2006.[7][8][9]
Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage and the slower and more experimental post-dubstep. The harsher electro-house and heavy metal-influenced variant brostep, led by American producers such as Skrillex, greatly contributed to dubstep's popularity in the United States.[10]"
"UK funky","UK funky (sometimes known as UKF or funky[1]) is a genre of electronic dance music which originated in England that is heavily influenced by soca, soulful house, tribal house, funky house, UK garage, broken beat and grime.[1] Typically, UK funky blends beats, bass loops and synths with African and Latin percussion in the dembow rhythm with contemporary R&B-style vocals.

UK funky uses tempos of around 130bpm. Drum patterns vary between tracks, using either ""4 to the floor"" or a syncopated style. The drum patterns commonly also include percussion playing African inspired rhythms. Instrumentation varies widely, but drum machines and synthesizers are common. There are similarities to garage in rhythmic, musical and vocal styles. UK funky is highly influenced by the tribal, soulful and bassline house subgenres. Similar genres include afro house,[2]broken beat, electro and garage.[citation needed]

US house producers such as Masters At Work, Karizma (with ""Twyst This""), Quentin Harris and Dennis Ferrer (with a remix of Fish Go Deep's ""The Cure and the Cause""; and with ""Hey Hey"") have had an influence on UK funky.

Hits from this genre include the Crazy Cousinz songs ""Do You Mind?"", ""Bongo Jam"" and ""The Funky Anthem"", and Fuzzy Logik featuring Egypt's ""In The Morning"". Popular songs have also produced dance crazes, such as ""Heads Shoulders Knees and Toes"", ""The Tribal Man Skank"" and ""The Migraine Skank"".[citation needed] Other notable artists include Apple, Marcus Nasty, Tribal Magz, Donae'o, KIG, Roska, Champion, iLL BLU, Lil' Silva and Funkystepz.[citation needed] DJs and MCs that have played a role in UK funky include DJ Pioneer, Supa D, MA1, Cameo, NG, MC Kaos Spidey G, Coldstepz, and Dogtaniaun & Versatile.[citation needed]

Funky Dee's ""Are You Gonna Bang Doe?"", recorded in 2009, achieved mainstream success and was signed to Universal Music Group. It was interpolated by Ed Sheeran in his viral 2010 freestyle alongside Example, the ""Nando's Skank"",[3] and was later interpolated by Sun Bingo for their 2018 ""Are You Gonna Bingo?"" advertising campaign.[4] The track was described by Tim Westwood as ""the summer soundtrack"" which ""replaced [Boy Better Know's] ""Too Many Man"" in the clubs""[5] and by TRENCH Magazine as an ""Ayia Napa anthem"".[6] Critics included Vice's Sam Diss, who considered it to be one of several tracks ""that practically confirmed [UK funky] would soon become the novelty soundtrack to every bad freshers week in the country, eventually leading to its demise"",[7] and Marcus Nasty, who claimed it contributed to the genre becoming ""kiddies' music"".[8]"
"Video game music","Video game music (VGM) is the soundtrack that accompanies video games. Early video game music was once limited to sounds of early sound chips, such as programmable sound generators (PSG) or FM synthesis chips. These limitations have led to the style of music known as chiptune, which became the sound of the first video games.

With technological advances, video game music has grown to include a wider range of sounds. Players can hear music in video games over a game's title screen, menus, and gameplay.[1] Game soundtracks can also change depending on a player's actions or situation, such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player they are in a dangerous situation, or rewarding them for specific achievements.

Video game music can be one of two kinds: original or licensed.[1]

The popularity of video game music has created education and job opportunities, generated awards, and led video game soundtracks to be commercially sold and performed in concerts.[2]

At the time video games had emerged as a popular form of entertainment in the late 1970s, music was stored on physical media in analog waveforms such as cassette tapes and phonograph records. Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use, making them less than ideal for use in an arcade cabinet, though in rare cases such as Journey, they were used. A more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means, where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves on the fly for output on a speaker. Sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion. An early example of such an approach to video game music was the opening chiptune in Tomohiro Nishikado's Gun Fight (1975).[3].mw-parser-output .side-box{margin:4px 0;box-sizing:border-box;border:1px solid #aaa;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em;background-color:#f9f9f9;display:flow-root}.mw-parser-output .side-box-abovebelow,.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{padding:0.25em 0.9em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-image{padding:2px 0 2px 0.9em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-imageright{padding:2px 0.9em 2px 0;text-align:center}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .side-box-flex{display:flex;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{flex:1;min-width:0}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .side-box{width:238px}.mw-parser-output .side-box-right{clear:right;float:right;margin-left:1em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-left{margin-right:1em}}.mw-parser-output .listen .side-box-text{line-height:1.1em}.mw-parser-output .listen-plain{border:none;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded{width:100%;margin:0;border-width:1px 0 0 0;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-header{padding:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded .listen-header{padding:2px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen-file-header{padding:4px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen .description{padding-top:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen .mw-tmh-player{max-width:100%}@media(max-width:719px){.mw-parser-output .listen{clear:both}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .listen:not(.listen-noimage){width:320px}.mw-parser-output .listen-left{overflow:visible;float:left}.mw-parser-output .listen-center{float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}}

While this allowed for the inclusion of music in early arcade video games, it was usually monophonic, looped or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game, such as the Namco titles Pac-Man (1980) composed by Toshio Kai or Pole Position (1982) composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi.[4] The first game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Tomohiro Nishikado's Space Invaders, released by Taito in 1978.[5] It had four descending chromatic bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player.[6] The first video game to feature continuous, melodic background music was Rally-X, released by Namco in 1980, featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay.[7] The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code. Some music was original, some was public domain music such as folk songs. Sound capabilities were limited; the popular Atari 2600 home system, for example, was capable of generating only two tones at a time.

As advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell, a definitively new generation of arcade machines and home consoles allowed for great changes in accompanying music. In arcades, machines based on the Motorola 68000 CPU and accompanying various Yamaha YM programmable sound generator sound chips allowed for several more tones or ""channels"" of sound, sometimes eight or more. The earliest known example of this was Sega's 1980 arcade game Carnival, which used an AY-3-8910 chip to create an electronic rendition of the classical 1889 composition ""Over The Waves"" by Juventino Rosas.[5]

Konami's 1981 arcade game Frogger introduced a dynamic approach to video game music, using at least eleven different gameplay tracks, in addition to level-starting and game over themes, which change according to the player's actions. This was further improved upon by Namco's 1982 arcade game Dig Dug, where the music stopped when the player stopped moving.[8]Dig Dug was composed by Yuriko Keino, who also composed the music for other Namco games such as Xevious (1982) and Phozon (1983).[4]Sega's 1982 arcade game Super Locomotive featured a chiptune rendition of Yellow Magic Orchestra's ""Rydeen"" (1979);[9] several later computer games also covered the song, such as Trooper Truck (1983) by Rabbit Software as well as Daley Thompson's Decathlon (1984) and Stryker's Run (1986) composed by Martin Galway.[10]

Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the ColecoVision in 1982 capable of four channels. However, more notable was the Japanese release of the Famicom in 1983 which was later released in the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. It was capable of five channels, one being capable of simple PCM sampled sound. The home computer Commodore 64 released in 1982 was capable of early forms of filtering effects, different types of waveforms and eventually the undocumented ability to play 4-bit samples on a pseudo fourth sound channel. Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers, as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor.

Approach to game music development in this time period usually involved using simple tone generation and/or frequency modulation synthesis to simulate instruments for melodies, and use of a ""noise channel"" for simulating percussive noises. Early use of PCM samples in this era was limited to short sound bites (Monopoly), or as an alternate for percussion sounds (Super Mario Bros. 3). The music on home consoles often had to share the available channels with other sound effects. For example, if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship, and the laser used a 1400 Hz square wave, then the square wave channel that was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect.

The mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before. Quality of composition improved noticeably, and evidence of the popularity of the music of this time period remains even today. Composers who made a name for themselves with their software include Koichi Sugiyama (Dragon Quest),[11]Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy), Rob Hubbard (Monty On the Run, International Karate), Koji Kondo (Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda), Miki Higashino (Gradius, Yie-Ar Kung Fu, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Hiroshi Kawaguchi (Space Harrier, Hang-On, Out Run), Hirokazu Tanaka (Metroid, Kid Icarus, EarthBound), Martin Galway (Daley Thompson's Decathlon, Stryker's Run, Times of Lore), David Wise (Donkey Kong Country), Yuzo Koshiro (Dragon Slayer, Ys, Shinobi, ActRaiser, Streets of Rage), Mieko Ishikawa (Dragon Slayer, Ys), and Ryu Umemoto (visual novels, shoot 'em ups). By the late 1980s, video game music was being sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan, inspiring American companies such as Sierra, Cinemaware and Interplay to give more serious attention to video game music by 1988.[12] The Golden Joystick Awards introduced a category for Best Soundtrack of the Year in 1986, won by Sanxion.

Some games for cartridge systems have been sold with extra audio hardware on board, including Pitfall II for the Atari 2600 and several late Famicom titles. These chips add to the existing sound capabilities.

From around 1980, some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized, or sampled, sounds. Namco's 1980 arcade game Rally-X was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator.[5] That same year, the first known video game to feature speech synthesis was also released: Sunsoft's shoot 'em up game Stratovox.[7] Around the same time,[13] the introduction of frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips, allowed the tones to be manipulated to have different sound characteristics, where before the tone generated by the chip was limited to the design of the chip itself. Konami's 1983 arcade game Gyruss used five synthesis sound chips along with a DAC, which were used to create an electronic version of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor.[14]

Beyond arcade games, significant improvements to personal computer game music were made possible with the introduction of digital FM synth boards, which Yamaha released for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s, and by the mid-1980s, the PC-8801 and FM-7 had built-in FM sound. The sound FM synth boards produced are described as ""warm and pleasant sound"". Musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community.[15] The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the 16-bit era, by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips.[13]

One of the earliest home computers to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the Amiga in 1985. The computer's sound chip featured four independent 8-bit digital-to-analog converters. Developers could use this platform to take samples of a music performance, sometimes just a single note long, and play it back through the computer's sound chip from memory. This differed from Rally-X in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple waveform samples, and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer. For its role in being one of the first and affordable, the Amiga would remain a staple tool of early sequenced music composing, especially in Europe.

The Amiga offered these features before most other competing home computer platforms though the Macintosh which had been introduced a year earlier had similar capabilities. The Amiga's main rival, the Atari ST, sourced the Yamaha YM2149 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG). Compared to the in-house designed Amiga sound engine, the PSG could only handle 1 channel of sampled sound, and needed the computer's CPU to process the data for it. This made it impractical for game development use until 1989 with the release of the Atari STE which used DMA techniques to play back PCM samples at up to 50 kHz. The ST, however, remained relevant as it was equipped with a MIDI controller and external ports. It became the choice of by many professional musicians as a MIDI programming device.

IBM PC clones in 1985 would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years, and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years. Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds, each sample required much more data in memory. This was at a time when all memory, solid-state (ROM cartridge), magnetic (floppy disk) or otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte. Sequenced soundchip-generated music, on the other hand, was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory.

Arcade systems pushed game music forward in 1984 with the introduction of FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis, providing more organic sounds than previous PSGs. The first such game, Marble Madness used the Yamaha YM2151 FM synthesis chip.[16]

As home consoles moved into the fourth generation, or 16-bit era, the hybrid approach (sampled and tone) to music composing continued to be used. The Sega Genesis offered advanced graphics over the NES and improved sound synthesis features (also using a Yamaha chip, the YM2612),[17] but largely held the same approach to sound design. Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in stereo instead of the NES's five channels in mono, one for PCM. As before, it was often used for percussion samples. The Genesis did not support 16-bit sampled sounds. Despite the additional tone channels, writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the FM synthesizer to create an enjoyable listening experience. The composer Yuzo Koshiro utilized the Genesis hardware effectively to produce ""progressive, catchy, techno-style compositions far more advanced than what players were used to"" for games such as The Revenge of Shinobi (1989) and the Streets of Rage series, setting a ""new high watermark for what music in games could sound like.""[18] The soundtrack for Streets of Rage 2 (1992) in particular is considered ""revolutionary"" and ""ahead of its time"" for its blend of house music with ""dirty"" electro basslines and ""trancey electronic textures"" that ""would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.""[19] Another important FM synth composer was the late Ryu Umemoto, who composed music for many visual novels and shoot 'em ups during the 1990s.[20]

As the cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes, the evolution of video game music on the Amiga, and some years later game music development in general, shifted to sampling in some form. It took some years before Amiga game designers learned to wholly use digitized sound effects in music (an early exception case was the title music of text adventure game The Pawn, 1986). By this time, computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity, and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the Commodore 64 and NES, which resulted in the chiptune genre.

The release of a freely-distributed Amiga program named Soundtracker by Karsten Obarski in 1987 started the era of MOD-format which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples. Module files were made with programs called ""trackers"" after Obarski's Soundtracker. This MOD/tracker tradition continued with PC computers in the 1990s. Examples of Amiga games using digitized instrument samples include David Whittaker's soundtrack for Shadow of the Beast, Chris Hülsbeck's soundtrack for Turrican 2 and Matt Furniss's tunes for Laser Squad. Richard Joseph also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by Sensible Software most famous being Cannon Fodder (1993) with a song ""War Has Never Been So Much Fun"" and Sensible World of Soccer (1994) with a song ""Goal Scoring Superstar Hero"". These songs used long vocal samples.

A similar approach to sound and music developments had become common in the arcades by this time and had been used in many arcade system boards since the mid-1980s.[21] This was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like Street Fighter II (1991) on the CPS-1, which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion. Neo Geo's MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound.

The evolution also carried into home console video games, such as the release of the Super Famicom in 1990, and its US/EU version Super NES in 1991. It sported a specialized custom Sony chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP. It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, had a wide selection of DSP effects, including a type of ADSR usually seen in high-end synthesizers of the time, and full stereo sound. This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like Super Castlevania IV, F-Zero, Final Fantasy IV, Gradius III, and later games like Chrono Trigger), directional (Star Fox) and spatial acoustics (Dolby Pro Logic was used in some games, like King Arthur's World and Jurassic Park), as well as environmental and architectural acoustics (A Link to the Past, Secret of Evermore). Many games also made heavy use of the high-quality sample playback capabilities (Super Star Wars, Tales of Phantasia). The only real limitation to this powerful setup was the still-costly solid state memory. Other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have the same circulation levels as the Super NES. The Neo-Geo home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart but was several times the cost of a Super NES. The Sega CD (the Mega CD outside North America) hardware upgrade to the Mega Drive (Genesis in the US) offered multiple PCM channels, but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the CD-ROM itself.

The popularity of the Super NES and its software remained limited to regions where NTSC television was the broadcast standard. Partly because of the difference in frame rates of PAL broadcast equipment, many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than had been intended, or were never released. This showed a divergence in popular video game music between PAL and NTSC countries that still shows to this day. This divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally, and as Commodore began to take a back seat to general-purpose PCs and Macs for developing and gaming.

Though the Mega CD/Sega CD, and to a greater extent the PC Engine in Japan, would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in streaming music, the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today. The huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the Fifth Generation. In 1994, the CD-ROM equipped PlayStation supported 24 channels of 16-bit samples of up to 44.1 kHz sample rate, samples equal to CD audio in quality. It also sported a few hardware DSP effects like reverb. Many Square titles continued to use sequenced music, such as Final Fantasy VII, Legend of Mana, and Final Fantasy Tactics. The Sega Saturn also with a CD drive supported 32 channels of PCM at the same resolution as the original PlayStation. In 1996, the Nintendo 64, still using a solid-state cartridge, actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of PCM, and an improved sample rate of 48 kHz. Games for the N64, because of the cost of the solid-state memory, typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two, however, and music tended to be simpler in construct.

The more dominant approach for games based on CDs, however, was shifting toward streaming audio.

In the same timeframe of the late 1980s to mid-1990s, the IBM PC clones using the x86 architecture became more ubiquitous, yet had a very different path in sound design than other PCs and consoles. Early PC gaming was limited to the PC speaker, and some proprietary standards such as the IBM PCjr 3-voice chip. While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare.

With the increase of x86 PCs in the market, there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill. The first two recognizable standards were the Roland MT-32, followed by the AdLib sound card. Roland's solution was driven by MIDI sequencing using advanced LA synthesizers. This made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon, but its higher cost as an end-user solution made it prohibitive. The AdLib used a low-cost FM synthesis chip from Yamaha, and many boards could operate compatibly using the MIDI standard.

The AdLib card was usurped in 1989 by Creative's Sound Blaster, which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib, for compatibility, but also added 8-bit 22.05 kHz (later 44.1 kHz) digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel. As an affordable end-user product, the Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s; a combination of a simple FM engine that supported MIDI, and a DAC engine of one or more streams. Only a minority of developers ever used Amiga-style tracker formats in commercial PC games, (Unreal) typically preferring to use the MT-32 or AdLib/SB-compatible devices. As general purpose PCs using x86 became more ubiquitous than the other PC platforms, developers drew their focus towards that platform.

The last major development before streaming music came in 1992: Roland Corporation released the first General MIDI card, the sample-based SCC-1, an add-in card version of the SC-55 desktop MIDI module. The comparative quality of the samples spurred similar offerings from Soundblaster, but costs for both products were still high. Both companies offered 'daughterboards' with sample-based synthesizers that could be later added to a less expensive soundcard (which only had a DAC and a MIDI controller) to give it the features of a fully integrated card.

Unlike the standards of Amiga or Atari, a PC using x86 even then could be using a broad mix of hardware. Developers increasingly used MIDI sequences: instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard, they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the Roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a MIDI controller to run the sequence. However, different products used different sounds attached to their MIDI controllers. Some tied into the Yamaha FM chip to simulate instruments, some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities; meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other General MIDI device.

All of these considerations in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapidly declined with the optical CD format.

Taking entirely pre-recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality. Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments, allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game. Quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself. Memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games. CD quality audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music.

In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a Mixed Mode CD audio track from a CD while the game was in play (such as Sonic CD). The earliest examples of Mixed Mode CD audio in video games include the TurboGrafx-CD RPG franchises Tengai Makyō, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto from 1989,[22] and the Ys series, composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa [jp] and arranged by Ryo Yonemitsu [jp] in 1989. The Ys soundtracks, particularly Ys I & II (1989), are still regarded as some of the most influential video game music ever composed.[23][24][25]

However, there were several disadvantages of regular CD-audio. Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed, so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing. Looping, the most common form of game music, was also a problem as when the laser reached the end of a track, it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback.

To address these drawbacks, some PC game developers designed their own container formats in house, for each application in some cases, to stream compressed audio. This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD, allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music, and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to buffer the data. A minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the CPU of a system. As computing power increased, this load became minimal, and in some cases, dedicated chips in a computer (such as a sound card) would actually handle all the decompressing.

Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback. Games would take full advantage of this ability, sometimes with highly praised results (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night). Games ported from arcade machines, which continued to use FM synthesis, often saw superior pre-recorded music streams on their home console counterparts (Street Fighter Alpha 2). Even though the game systems were capable of ""CD quality"" sound, these compressed audio tracks were not true ""CD quality."" Many of them had lower sampling rates, but not so significant that most consumers would notice. Using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music, at the cost of CPU power used to render the audio stream. Manipulating the stream any further would require a far more significant level of CPU power available in the 5th generation.

Some games, such as the Wipeout series, continued to use full Mixed Mode CD audio for their soundtracks.

This overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked. A musician could now, with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself, independently produce the music to their satisfaction. This flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically. An early example is Way of the Warrior on the 3DO, with music by White Zombie. A more well-known example is Trent Reznor's score for Quake.

An alternate approach, as with the TMNT arcade, was to take pre-existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game. The game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter and subsequent Star Wars games took music composed by John Williams for the Star Wars films of the 1970s and 1980s and used it for the game soundtracks.

Both using new music streams made specifically for the game, and using previously released/recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day. It is common for X-games sports-based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (SSX, Tony Hawk, Initial D), as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (Need For Speed: Underground, Gran Turismo, and Grand Theft Auto). Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in Dance Dance Revolution.

Many sports game titles like Madden NFL, NBA 2K, and FIFA use popular and underground songs in their soundtrack to give their menus atmosphere. The phrase ""FIFA song"" has become popular in recent years, it describes a song (often not American) that is upbeat and has lots of rhythm. The inclusion on the FIFA soundtrack has given many artists exposure that helped launch their music careers.

Sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming where fully recorded audio is not viable. Until the mid-2000s, many larger games on home consoles used sequenced audio to save space. Additionally, most games on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS used sequenced music due to storage limitations. Sometimes a cross between sequencing samples, and streaming music is used. Games such as Republic: The Revolution (music composed by James Hannigan[26]) and Command & Conquer: Generals (music composed by Bill Brown) have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the player's most recent choices (see dynamic music). Other games dynamically mixed the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment.

As processing power increased dramatically in the 6th generation of home consoles, it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio. In SSX, a recent video game series, if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp, the music softens or muffles a bit, and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne. When the snowboarder lands, the music resumes regular playback until its next ""cue"". The LucasArts company pioneered this interactive music technique with their iMUSE system, used in their early adventure games and the Star Wars flight simulators Star Wars: X-Wing and Star Wars: TIE Fighter. Action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger. Stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music, either by handling streams differently, or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack.

Being able to play one's own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternative music player. Some early exceptions were possible on PC/Windows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background. Some PC games, such as Quake, play music from the CD while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk, thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD. The first PC game to introduce in-game support for custom soundtracks was Lionhead Studio's Black & White. The 2001 game included an in-game interface for Winamp that enabled the players to play audio tracks from their own playlists. In addition, this would sometimes trigger various reactions from the player's Creature, like dancing or laughing.

Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD, although when the game needed data, players had to swap the CDs again. One of the earliest games, Ridge Racer, was loaded entirely into RAM, letting the player insert a music CD to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay. In Vib Ribbon, this became a gameplay feature, with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever CD the player inserted.

Microsoft's Xbox allowed music to be copied from a CD onto its internal hard drive, to be used as a ""Custom Soundtrack"", if enabled by the game developer. The feature carried over into the Xbox 360 where it became supported by the system software and could be enabled at any point. The Wii is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game (Excite Truck,[27]Endless Ocean[28]). The PlayStation Portable can, in games like Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City and FIFA 08, play music from a Memory Stick.

The PlayStation 3 has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive, however few game developers used this function. MLB 08: The Show, released in 2008, has a My MLB sound track feature that allows the user to play music tracks of their choice saved on the hard drive of their PS3, rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer. An update to Wipeout HD, released on the PlayStation Network, was made to also incorporate this feature.[29]

In the video game Audiosurf, custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game. Users have to pick a music file to be analyzed. The game will generate a race track based on tempo, pitch and complexity of the sound. The user will then race on this track, synchronized with the music.

Games in the Grand Theft Auto series have supported custom soundtracks, using them as a separate in-game radio station. The feature was primarily exclusive to PC versions, and was adopted to a limited degree on console platforms. On a PC, inserting custom music into the stations is done by placing music files into a designated folder. For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console's hard drive. For the iPhone version of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, players create an iTunes playlist which is then played by the game.

Forza Horizon 3 used a similar technology of custom soundtracks with the help of Groove Music.

The Xbox 360 supports Dolby Digital software, sampling and playback rate of 16-bit @ 48 kHz (internal; with 24-bit hardware D/A converters), hardware codec streaming, and potential of 256 audio simultaneous channels.[30] While powerful and flexible, none of these features represent any major change in how game music is made from the last generation of console systems. PCs continue to rely on third-party devices for in-game sound reproduction, and SoundBlaster is largely the only major player in the entertainment audio expansion card business.

The PlayStation 3 handles multiple types of surround sound technology, including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, with up to 7.1 channels, and with sampling rates of up to 192 kHz.

Nintendo's Wii console shares many audio components with the GameCube from the previous generation, including Dolby Pro Logic II. These features are extensions of technology already currently in use.[31]

The game developer of today has many choices on how to develop music. More likely, changes in video game music creation will have very little to do with technology and more to do with other factors of game development as a business whole. Video game music has diversified much to the point where scores for games can be presented with a full orchestra or simple 8/16-bit chiptunes. This degree of freedom has made the creative possibilities of video game music limitless to developers. As sales of video game music diverged from the game itself in the West (compared to Japan where game music CDs had been selling for years), business elements also wield a new level of influence. Music from outside the game developer's immediate employment, such as music composers and pop artists, have been contracted to produce game music just as they would for a theatrical movie. Many other factors have growing influence, such as editing for content, politics on some level of the development, and executive input.

Many video game players believe that music can enhance game play and outlets such as Popular Science have stated that it is designed to ""simultaneously stimulate your senses and blend into the background of your brain, because that's the point of the soundtrack. It has to engage you, the player, in a task without distracting from it. In fact, the best music would actually direct the listener to the task.""[32]

Sound effects within game play are also believed to impact game performance. Ambient sounds such as those present in Resident Evil are seen to enhance the tension felt by players, something that GameSpot stated was also used in cinema.[33] Speeding up the sound effects and music in games such as Space Invaders is also stated to have a strong impact on the gaming experience when done properly.[33] Properly done, this can help create realism within virtuality and alert players to important scenes and information.[34][35]

Music and sound effects can become memorable, enabling people to instantly recognize music or sound effects as well as hum or mimic the tune or sound effect.[36] Polygon has stated that despite the popularity of video game music, people may not always know the name of the composer.[36]

Using licensed music for video games became more popular as the medium used to distribute games grew large enough to accommodate songs alongside a game's other assets. Additionally, with the large growth of the video game market in the 2000s, song licensing became a lucrative route for music rights holders to gain part of that revenue. Games like those in the Grand Theft Auto series became showcases of licensed music.[37]Music licensing is generally complicated due to various copyright laws, typically with at least two separate copyrights to consider: the songwriters' and the performers' contributions. Most large video game developers and publishers who use licensed music typically have staff proficient in licensing to clear songs for use in video games with the various music labels and other creative persons.[37]

Games with licensed music can have problems well past release if perpetual rights for the music are not secured for the game. Early games before the onset of digital distribution would have perpetual right for the music since there was no practical way to update the game following release at retail to deal with curtailed rights. However, digital distribution platforms, like Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network keep games up-to-date automatically. Music licenses for games sold through digital distribution may include limited terms, requiring the publisher to re-negotiate rights with the music's owner, or otherwise the music must be removed from the game through these updates.[37] Notably, Alan Wake by Remedy Entertainment, first released in 2010, had to be pulled from digital sale in 2017 due to expiring music rights.[38] However, with Microsoft's help, Remedy was able to re-secure these rights a year later and returned the game for sale.[39]Alpha Protocol by Obsidian Entertainment was also pulled from sale in 2019 due to expiring music license rights, though there are no known plans if publisher Sega will seek to renew these.[40]

Licensed music in video games has also affected video game streaming, such as Let's Play videos. Due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), most popular video sharing and streaming sites implement automatic forms of detecting copyrighted music from most music labels, and flag or block user videos that employ that music, such as YouTube's Content ID system. These actions apply equally to videos of people playing video games, flagging the video from the licensed music in the game. To avoid this, games using licensed music may offer a ""stream-safe"" music option, either disabling the music playback or replacing the licensed music with copyright-free or royalty-free music.[41][42]

Many games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the ""video game genre."" Some aspects of this style continue to influence certain music today, though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with the older style. The genre's compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints, while also being influenced by electronic music bands, particularly Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), who were popular during the late 1970s to 1980s.[43] YMO sampled sounds from several classic arcade games in their early albums, most notably Space Invaders in the 1978 hit song ""Computer Game"".[44] In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.[43]

Features of the video game music genre include:

Although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of as emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise channel used for drums), composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes, in part due to the restrictions mentioned above.[45][46][47] This is similar to music composition during the Baroque period, when composers, particularly when creating solo pieces, focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics. For the same reason, many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence. These would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and J-pop music, resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16-bit era.

In an unrelated but parallel course in the European and North American developer scene, similar limitations were driving the musical style of home computer games. Module file format music, particularly MOD, used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced by the electronic music scene as it developed, and resulted in another very distinct subgenre. Demos and the developing demoscene played a big part in the early years, and still influence video game music today.

As technological limitations gradually lifted, composers were given more freedom and, with the advent of CD-ROM, pre-recorded soundtracks came to dominate, resulting in a noticeable shift in composition and voicing style.[48] Popular early CD-ROM titles were released with high-resolution graphics and recorded music. Since the audio was not reliant on a sound-card's synthesis, CD-ROM technology ensured that composers and sound designers could know what audio would sound like on most consumer configurations and could also record sound effects, live instruments, vocals, and in-game dialogue.[49]

Appreciation for video game music is strong among fans and composers, particularly for music from the third and fourth generations of home video game consoles, and sometimes newer generations. This appreciation has been shown outside the context of a video game, in the form of CDs, sheet music, public performances, art installations, and popular music.

Selling video game soundtracks separately as CDs has become increasingly popular in the industry.[5] Interpretive albums, remixes, and live performance albums were also common variations to original soundtracks (OSTs).[50]

Koichi Sugiyama was an early figure in this practice, and following the release of the first Dragon Quest game in 1986, a live performance CD of his compositions was released and performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble (then later by other groups including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra).

By 1987, Sega were selling 50,000 to 100,000 game soundtrack CDs annually.[51] Yuzo Koshiro, another early figure, released a live performance of the Actraiser soundtrack. Both Koshiro's and fellow Falcom composer Mieko Ishikawa's contributions to Ys music would have such long-lasting impact that there were more albums released of Ys music than of almost all other game-type music.

Like anime soundtracks, these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in Japan. Therefore, interested gamers outside Japan had to import the soundtracks and/or sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports. This has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the OSTs for sale in UK and US, though these are often for more popular titles. Video game music companies like Materia Collective have pursued and produced published book editions of video game music.

The sale of video game soundtracks has created a growing symbiotic relationship between the music industry and the games industry.[5] Commonly, games are being used to promote and sell licensed music, rather than just original score, and recording artists are being used to market and sell games.[5] Music marketing agency Electric Artists conducted a study that revealed a number of interesting statistics surrounding ""hard-core gamers"" and their music habits: 40% of hard-core gamers bought the CD after hearing a song they liked in a video game, 73% of gamers said soundtracks within games help sell more CDs, and 40% of respondents said a game introduced them to a new band or song, then 27% of them went out and bought what they heard.[5] Some game soundtracks have become so popular they have reached platinum status, such as NBA Live 2003.[5]

Many original composers have publicly exhibited their music through symphonic concert performances. Once again, Koichi Sugiyama was the first to execute this practice in 1987 with his ""Family Classic Concert"" featuring live performances of Dragon Quest music and had continued these concert performances almost annually. In 1991, he also formed a series called Orchestral Game Music Concerts, notable for featuring music of other talented game composers such as Yoko Kanno (Nobunaga's Ambition, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Uncharted Waters), Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy), Keiichi Suzuki (Mother/Earthbound), and Kentaro Haneda (Wizardry).[52]

Following suit, compositions by Nobuo Uematsu on Final Fantasy IV were arranged into Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon, a live performance by string musicians with strong Celtic influence recorded in Ireland. The Love Theme from the same game has been used as an instructional piece of music in Japanese schools.[53]

With the success of Square's 1990s games Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by Nobuo Uematsu, and Chrono Trigger, Xenogears and Chrono Cross by Yasunori Mitsuda, public performance began to gain international popularity. On August 20, 2003, music written for video games such as Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda was performed for the first time outside Japan, by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in a Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany at the Gewandhaus concert hall.[50] This event was held as the official opening ceremony of Europe's biggest trading fair for video games, the GC Games Convention and repeated in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.[50]

On November 17, 2003, Square Enix launched the Final Fantasy Radio on America Online. The radio station has initially featured complete tracks from Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XI: Rise of Zilart and samplings from Final Fantasy VII through Final Fantasy X.[50]

The first officially sanctioned Final Fantasy concert in the United States was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California, on May 10, 2004.[54] All seats at the concert were sold out in a single day. ""Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy"" followed and was performed at various cities across the United States. Nobuo Uematsu has also performed a variety of Final Fantasy compositions live with his rock band, The Black Mages.[55]

On July 6, 2005, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra also held a Video Games Live concert at the Hollywood Bowl, an event founded by video game music composers Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall.[50] This concert featured a variety of video game music, ranging from Pong to Halo 2. It also incorporated real-time video feeds that were in sync with the music, as well as laser and light special effects. Media outside the video game industry, such as NPR and The New York Times, have covered their subsequent world tours.[56][57]

On August 20, 2006, the Malmö Symphonic Orchestra with host Orvar Säfström performed the outdoor game music concert Joystick in Malmö, Sweden before an audience of 17,000, holding the current record of attendance for a game music concert.[58] Säfström has since continued to produce game music concerts around Europe under the names Joystick and Score.[59]

From April 20–27, 2007, Eminence Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra dedicated to video game and anime music, performed the first part of their annual tour, the ""A Night in Fantasia"" concert series in Australia. Whilst Eminence had performed video game music as part of their concerts since their inception, the 2007 concert marked the first time ever that the entire setlist was pieces from video games. Up to seven of the world's most famous game composers were also in attendance as special guests. Music performed included Red Alert 3 Theme: Soviet March by James Hannigan and Shadow of the Colossus by Kow Otani.

Since 2010, video games-themed ""pops"" concerts have become a major proportion of the revenue in many United States concert halls, as traditional classical music performances decline in popularity.[60]

On March 16, 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum's ""The Art of Video Games"" exhibit opened featuring a chipmusic soundtrack at the entrance by artists 8 Bit Weapon & ComputeHer.[61] 8 Bit Weapon also created a track called ""The art of Video Games Anthem"" for the exhibit as well.[62]

The first video game music-focused concert for the BBC Proms was held on August 1, 2022.[63]

In the popular music industry, video game music and sounds have appeared in songs by various popular artists.[64] Arcade game sounds had a particularly strong influence on the hip hop,[65]pop music (particularly synthpop)[66] and electro music[67] genres during the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s. Arcade game sounds had an influence on synthpop pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra,[68] who sampled Space Invaders sounds in their influential 1978 debut album, particularly the hit song ""Computer Game"".[44] In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.[43]

Other pop songs based on Space Invaders soon followed, including ""Disco Space Invaders"" (1979) by Funny Stuff,[69] ""Space Invaders"" (1980) by Playback,[70] and the hit songs ""Space Invader"" (1980) by The Pretenders[69] and ""Space Invaders"" (1980) by Uncle Vic.[71]Buckner & Garcia produced a successful album dedicated to video game music in 1982, Pac-Man Fever.[72] Former YMO member Haruomi Hosono also released a 1984 album produced entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled Video Game Music, an early example of a chiptune record[73] and the first video game music album.[74]Warp's record ""Testone"" (1990) by Sweet Exorcist sampled video game sounds from YMO's ""Computer Game"" and defined Sheffield's bleep techno scene in the early 1990s.[75] In 1991, American alternative rock band Pixies released a cover version of the main theme from the arcade game Narc as a B-side to the single ""Planet of Sound"".[76]

More recently, ""video game beats"" have appeared in popular songs such as Kesha's ""Tik Tok"",[64] the best-selling single of 2010,[77] as well as ""U Should Know Better"" by Robyn featuring Snoop Dogg,[64] and ""Hellbound"" by Eminem. The influence of video game music can also be seen in contemporary electronica music by artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Kieran Hebden.[68]Grime music in particular samples sawtooth wave sounds from video games which were popular in East London.[78] English power metal band DragonForce is also known for their ""retro video game influenced"" sound.

Video game music has become part of the curriculum at the degree, undergraduate, and graduate levels in many traditional colleges and universities.[79] According to the Entertainment Software Association, there are over 400 schools offering courses and degrees in video game design in the United States, many of which include sound and music design[80].[81]Berklee College of Music, Yale University, New York University, and the New England Conservatory have all introduced game music into their music programs. These programs offer immersive education in music composition, orchestration, editing and production.[82] Other post-secondary schools have more games-focused programs, such as DigiPen Institute of Technology, Columbia College Chicago, and Academy of Art University,[83] who all offer programs in Music and Sound Design.[84] These programs include courses in sound effect creation, interactive sound design, and scripting music.[85]

Similar programs have gained popularity in Europe. The Utrecht School of the Arts (Faculty of Art, Media and Technology) has offered a Game Sound and Music Design program since 2003. The University of Hertfordshire has a program in Music Composition and Technology for Film and Games, Leeds Beckett University offers Sound and Music for Interactive Games, and dBs Music Bristol teaches Sound for Games and Apps.[86][87][88]

More informal institutions, like the training seminars at GameSoundCon also feature classes in how to compose video game music.[89]

Extracurricular organizations devoted to the performance of video game music have also been implemented in tandem with these new curriculum programs. The Gamer Symphony Orchestra at the University of Maryland performs self-arranged video game music and the Video Game Orchestra is a semiprofessional outgrowth of students from the Berklee College of Music and other Boston-area schools.[90]

According to the National Association for Music Education, video game music is now being taught at elementary and secondary school levels to aid in the understanding of music composition.[91] Students at Magruder High School in Montgomery County, Maryland have even started a student-run gamer orchestra, and many high school bands perform game music.[90]

Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,[92] and developed through the mid-2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article ""Play Along – An Approach to Videogame Music"" which includes both).[93] The study of video game music is also known by some as ""ludomusicology"" – a portmanteau of ""ludology"" (the study of games and gameplay) and ""musicology"" (the study and analysis of music) – a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.[94][95]

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the University of Waterloo and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute. Her monograph Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design (MIT Press 2008)[96] is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.[citation needed]

The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.[97] Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).[98] The group was founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music, published in July 2016.[99][100] They also edited a double special issue of The Soundtrack[101] and initiated a new book series for the Study in Game Sound and Music[102] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book 'Understanding Video Game Music' was published by Cambridge University Press.[103][104]
Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal ACT – Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance,[105] published in July 2011, which included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven B. Reale and Jason Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in musicology, Fritsch's background is in performance studies.[citation needed]

The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.[106] It is organised by Neil Lerner, Steven Beverburg Reale and William Gibbons.[107]

In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.[107] The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its focus is the use of its website as a ""hub"" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).[108]

The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched by Barnabas Smith in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to ""offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region.""[109]

Creating and producing video game music requires strong teams and coordination among the different divisions of game development.[1] As the market has expanded, so have the types of jobs in game music. The process often starts with the game designer, who will have a specific musical theme or genre in mind for the game.[1] Their options include contracting original composers or licensing existing music, both of which require other music experts.

During the arcade and early console era (1983 to the mid-1990s), most game music was composed by full-time employees of the particular game company producing the game. This was largely due to the very specialized nature of video game music, where each system had its own technology and tool sets. It was not uncommon for a game company like Capcom or Konami to have a room full of composers, each at their own workstation with headphones writing music.[110]

Once the CD-era hit and studio recorded music became more ubiquitous in games, it became increasingly common for game music to be composed by independent contractors, hired by the game developer on a per-project basis.[111][112] Most bigger budget games such as Call of Duty, Mass Effect, Ghost Recon, or Lost Planet hire composers in this fashion. Approximately 50% of game composers are freelance, the remaining being employees of a game company.[113] Original score and soundtrack may require the hiring of a music director, who will help create the game music as well as help book the resources needed for performing and recording the music.[1] Some music directors may work with a game's Sound Designer to create a dynamic score.[1] Notable exceptions include composer Koji Kondo, who remains an employee at Nintendo, and Martin O'Donnell, who worked at Bungie until early 2014.[114]

The growth of casual, mobile and social games has greatly increased opportunities for game music composers, with job growth in the US market increasing more than 150% over five years.[115] Independently developed games are a frequent place where beginning game composers gain experience composing for video games.[112] Game composers, particularly for smaller games, are likely to provide other services such as sound design (76% of game composers also do some sound design), integration (47% of game composers also integrate their music into audio middleware), or even computer coding or scripting (15%).[116]

With the rising use of licensed popular music in video games, job opportunities in game music have also come to include the role of a music supervisor. Music supervisors work on behalf of a game developer or game publisher to source pre-existing music from artists and music publishers. These supervisors can be hired on a per-project basis or can work in-house, like the Music Group for Electronic Arts (EA) that has a team of music supervisors.[117] A music supervisor is needed to not only help select music that will suit the game, but to also ensure the music is fully licensed in order to avoid lawsuits or conflicts.[1] Music supervisors may also help negotiate payment, which for artists and songwriters is often a one-time buy-out fee, because games do not generate music royalties when they are sold.[1] A growing trend is to contract artists to write original songs for games, to add to their value and exclusivity, and once again supervisors can be a part of that process.[5]

In 2011, video game music made its first appearance at the Grammy Awards when ""Baba Yetu"", a song from Civilization IV, won the 53rd annual music awards' Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists, making it the first video game music to be nominated for (or to win) a Grammy. The song won for its placement on Christopher Tin's album Calling All Dawns, but had been used in the game six years prior.[131] In 2022, video game music made another appearance at the Grammy Awards, with The 8-Bit Big Band's cover  (arranged by Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman) of ""Meta Knight's Revenge"", a song from Kirby Super Star, winning the 64th Annual Grammy Awards' Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Capella.[132][133]

Other video game awards include the International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) award for Best Original Score for Interactive Media and Machinima.com's Inside Gaming Awards for Best Original Score and Best Sound Design.[citation needed]

In addition to recognizing the composers of original score, the Guild of Music Supervisors offer a GMS Award to the music supervisors that select and coordinate licensed music for video games.[134]

Video game fans have created their own fan sites ""dedicated to the appreciation and promotion of video game music"", such as OverClocked ReMix.[135]

Fans also make their own song remixes and compilations, like insaneintherainmusic, and have built online remixing communities through the ease of internet distribution.[5]

The Japanese dōjin music scene is notable for producing albums of arranged videogame music which derived from popular retro franchises such as Mega Man, Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy,[136] from dōjin games, such as Touhou Project, studio Key visual novels and When They Cry series, from popular franchises on Comiket, such as Type-Moon's Fate series or Kantai Collection.[137] There have been over six thousand dōjin albums of Touhou Project music released.[138]"
"American folk music revival","

The American folk music revival began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Josh White, Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy,  Richard Dyer-Bennet, Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie, John Jacob Niles, Susan Reed, Paul Robeson, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and Cisco Houston had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward styles of American folk music that had in earlier times contributed to the development of country and western, blues, jazz, and rock and roll music.

The folk revival in New York City was rooted in the resurgent interest in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s as espoused by instructors such as Margot Mayo, which gave musicians such as Pete Seeger popular exposure.[2][3][4] The folk revival more generally as a popular and commercial phenomenon begins with the career of The Weavers, formed in November 1948 by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Ronnie Gilbert of People's Songs, of which Seeger had been president and Hays executive secretary. People's Songs, which disbanded in 1948–49, had been a clearing house for labor movement songs (and in particular the CIO, which at the time was one of the few if not the only union federation that was racially integrated), and in 1948 had thrown all its resources to the failed presidential campaign of Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace, a folk-music aficionado (his running mate was a country-music singer-guitarist). Hays and Seeger had formerly sung together as the politically activist Almanac Singers, a group which they founded in 1941 and whose personnel often included Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Lead Belly, Cisco Houston, and Bess Lomax Hawes. The Weavers had a big hit in 1950 with the single of Lead Belly's ""Goodnight, Irene"". This was number one on the Billboard charts for thirteen weeks.[5] On its flip side was ""Tzena, Tzena, Tzena"", an Israeli dance song that concurrently reached number two on the charts. This was followed by a string of Weaver hit singles that sold millions, including """"So Long It's Been Good to Know You"" (""Dusty Old Dust"") (by Woody Guthrie) and ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"". The Weavers' career ended abruptly when they were dropped from Decca's catalog because Pete Seeger had been listed in the publication Red Channels as a probable subversive. Radio stations refused to play their records and concert venues canceled their engagements. A former employee of People's Songs, Harvey Matusow, himself a former Communist Party member, had informed the FBI that the Weavers were Communists, too, although Matusow later recanted and admitted he had lied. Pete Seeger and Lee Hays were called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1955. Despite this, a Christmas Weaver reunion concert organized by Harold Leventhal in 1955 was a smash success and the Vanguard LP album of that concert, issued in 1957, was one of the top sellers of that year, followed by other successful albums.

Folk music, which often carried the stigma of left-wing associations during the 1950s Red Scare, was driven underground and carried along by a handful of artists releasing records. Barred from mainstream outlets, artists like Seeger were restricted to performing in schools and summer camps, and the folk-music scene became a phenomenon associated with vaguely rebellious bohemianism in places like New York (especially Greenwich Village) and San Francisco's  North Beach, and in the college and university districts of cities like Chicago, Boston, Denver, and elsewhere.

Ron Eyerman and Scott Baretta speculate that:

[I]t is interesting to consider that had it not been for the explicit political sympathies of the Weavers and other folk singers or, another way of looking at it, the hysterical anti-communism of the Cold War, folk music would very likely have entered mainstream American culture in even greater force in the early 1950s, perhaps making the second wave of the revival nearly a decade later [i.e., in the 1960s] redundant.[6]

The media blackout of performers with alleged communist sympathies or ties was so effective that Israel Young, a chronicler of the 1960s Folk Revival who was drawn into the movement through an interest in folk dancing, communicated to Ron Eyerman that he himself was unaware for many years of the movement's 1930s and early '40s antecedents in left-wing political activism.[7]

In the early and mid-1950s, acoustic-guitar-accompanied folk songs were mostly heard in coffee houses, private parties, open-air concerts, and sing-alongs, hootenannies, and at college-campus concerts. Often associated with political dissent, folk music now blended, to some degree, with the so-called beatnik scene, and dedicated singers of folk songs (as well as folk-influenced original material) traveled through what was called ""the coffee-house circuit"" across the U.S. and Canada, home also to cool jazz and recitations of highly personal beatnik poetry. Two singers of the 1950s who sang folk material but crossed over into the mainstream were Odetta and Harry Belafonte, both of whom sang Lead Belly and Josh White material. Odetta, who had trained as an opera singer, performed traditional blues, spirituals, and songs by Lead Belly. Belafonte had hits with Jamaican calypso material as well as the folk song-like sentimental ballad ""Scarlet Ribbons"" (composed in 1949).

The Kingston Trio, a group originating on the West Coast, were directly inspired by the Weavers in their style and presentation and covered some of the Weavers' material, which was predominantly traditional. The Kingston Trio avoided overtly political or protest songs and cultivated a clean-cut collegiate persona. They were discovered while playing at a college club called the Cracked Pot by Frank Werber, who became their manager and secured them a deal with Capitol Records. Their first hit was a rewritten rendition of an old-time folk murder ballad, ""Tom Dooley"", which had been sung at Lead Belly's funeral concert. This went gold in 1958 and sold more than three million copies. The success of the album and the single earned the Kingston Trio a Grammy award for Best Country & Western Performance at the awards' inaugural ceremony in 1959. At the time, no folk-music category existed in the Grammy's scheme. The next year, largely as a result of The Kingston Trio album and ""Tom Dooley"",[8] the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences instituted a folk category and the Trio won the first Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording for its second studio album At Large.  At one point, The Kingston Trio had four records at the same time among the top 10 selling albums for five consecutive weeks in November and December 1959 according to Billboard magazine's ""Top LPs"" chart, a record unmatched for more than 50 years[9][10][11][12][13][14] and noted at the time by a cover story in Life magazine. The huge commercial success of the Kingston Trio, whose recordings between 1958 and 1961 earned more than $25 million for Capitol records[15] or about $220 million in 2021 dollars,[16] spawned a host of groups that were similar in some respects like the Brothers Four, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Limeliters, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The New Christy Minstrels, and more. As noted by critic Bruce Eder in the All Music Guide, the popularity of the commercialized version of folk music represented by these groups emboldened record companies to sign, record, and promote artists with more traditionalist and political sensibilities.[17]

The Kingston Trio's popularity would be followed by that of Joan Baez, whose debut album Joan Baez reached the top ten in late 1960 and remained on the Billboard charts for over two years. Baez's early albums contained mostly traditional material, such as the Scottish ballad ""Mary Hamilton"", as well as many covers of melancholy tunes that had appeared in Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, such as ""The Wagoner's Lad"" and ""The Butcher Boy"". She did not try to imitate the singing style of her source material, however, but used a rich soprano with vibrato. Her popularity (and that of the folk revival itself) would place Baez on the cover of Time magazine in November 1962. Unlike the Kingston Trio, Baez was openly political, and as the civil rights movement gathered steam, she aligned herself with Pete Seeger, Guthrie and others. Baez was one of the singers with Seeger, Josh White, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Bob Dylan who appeared at Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington and sang ""We Shall Overcome"", a song that had been introduced by People's Songs. Harry Belafonte was also present on that occasion, as was Odetta, whom Martin Luther King introduced as ""the queen of folk music"" when she sang ""Oh, Freedom"". (Odetta Sings Folk Songs was one of 1963's best-selling folk albums). Also on hand were the SNCC Freedom Singers, the personnel of which went on to form Sweet Honey in the Rock.

The critical role played by Freedom Songs in the voter registration drives, freedom rides, and lunch counter sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1950s and early '60s in the South gave folk music tremendous new visibility and prestige.[18] The peace movement was likewise energized by the rise of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the UK, protesting the British testing of the H-bomb in 1958, as well as by the ever-proliferating arms race and the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War. Young singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, playing acoustic guitar and harmonica, had been signed and recorded for Columbia by producer John Hammond in 1961. Dylan's record enjoyed some popularity among Greenwich Village folk-music enthusiasts, but he was ""discovered"" by an immensely larger audience when Peter, Paul & Mary had a hit with a cover of his song ""Blowin' in the Wind"". That trio also brought Pete Seeger's and the Weavers' ""If I Had a Hammer""  to nationwide audiences, as well as covering songs by other artists such as Dylan and John Denver.

It was not long before the folk-music category came to include less traditional material and more personal and poetic creations by individual performers, who called themselves ""singer-songwriters"". As a result of the financial success of high-profile commercial folk artists, record companies began to produce and distribute records by a new generation of folk revival and singer-songwriters—Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Eric von Schmidt, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Dave Van Ronk, Judy Collins, Tom Rush, Fred Neil, Gordon Lightfoot, Billy Ed Wheeler, John Denver, John Stewart, Arlo Guthrie, Harry Chapin, and John Hartford, among others. Some of this wave had emerged from family singing and playing traditions, and some had not. These singers frequently prided themselves on performing traditional material in imitations of the style of the source singers whom they had discovered, frequently by listening to Harry Smith's celebrated LP compilation of forgotten or obscure commercial 78rpm ""race"" and ""hillbilly"" recordings of the 1920s and 30s, the Folkways Anthology of American Folk Music (1951). A number of the artists who had made these old recordings were still very much alive and had been ""rediscovered"" and brought to the 1963 and 64 Newport Folk Festivals. For example, traditionalist Clarence Ashley introduced folk revivalists to the music of friends of his who still actively played the older music, such as Doc Watson and The Stanley Brothers.

During the 1950s, the growing folk-music crowd that had developed in the United States began to buy records by older, traditional musicians from the Southeastern hill country and from urban inner-cities. New LP compilations of commercial 78-rpm race and hillbilly studio recordings stretching back to the 1920s and 1930s were published by major record labels. The expanding market in LP records increased the availability of folk-music field recordings originally made by John and Alan Lomax, Kenneth S. Goldstein, and other collectors during the New Deal era of the 1930s and 40s. Small record labels, such as Yazoo Records, grew up to distribute reissued older recordings and to make new recordings of the survivors among these artists. This was how many urban white American audiences of the 1950s and 60s first heard country blues and especially Delta blues that had been recorded by Mississippi folk artists 30 or 40 years before.

In 1952, Folkways Records released the Anthology of American Folk Music, compiled by anthropologist and experimental film maker Harry Smith. The Anthology featured 84 songs by traditional country and blues artists, initially recorded between 1927 and 1932, and was credited with making a large amount of pre-War material accessible to younger musicians. (The Anthology was re-released on CD in 1997, and Smith was belatedly presented with a Grammy Award for his achievement in 1991.)[19]

Artists like the Carter Family, Robert Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Clarence Ashley, Buell Kazee, Uncle Dave Macon, Mississippi John Hurt, and the Stanley Brothers, as well as Jimmie Rodgers, the Reverend Gary Davis, and Bill Monroe came to have something more than a regional or ethnic reputation. The revival turned up a tremendous wealth and diversity of music and put it out through radio shows and record stores.

Living representatives of some of the varied regional and ethnic traditions, including younger performers like Southern-traditional singer Jean Ritchie, who had first begun recording in the 1940s, also enjoyed a resurgence of popularity through enthusiasts' widening discovery of this music and appeared regularly at folk festivals.

Ethnic folk music from other countries also had a boom during the American folk revival. The most successful ethnic performers of the revival were the Greenwich Village folksingers, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, whom Billboard magazine listed as the eleventh best-selling folk musicians in the United States.[20] The group, which consisted of Paddy Clancy, Tom Clancy, Liam Clancy, and Tommy Makem, predominantly sang English-language, Irish folk songs, as well as an occasional song in Irish Gaelic. Paddy Clancy also started and ran the folk-music label Tradition Records, which produced Odetta's first solo LP and initially brought Carolyn Hester to national prominence.[21] Pete Seeger played the banjo on their Grammy-nominated 1961 album, A Spontaneous Performance Recording,[22][23] and Bob Dylan later cited the group as a major influence on him.[24] The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem also sparked a folk-music boom in Ireland in the mid-1960s, illustrating the world-wide effects of the American folk-music revival.[25][26][27][28][29]

Books such as the popular best seller, the Fireside Book of Folk Songs (1947), which contributed to the folk song revival, featured some material in languages other than English, including German, Spanish, Italian, French, Yiddish, and Russian. The repertoires of Theodore Bikel, Marais and Miranda, and Martha Schlamme also included Hebrew and Jewish material, as well as Afrikaans. The Weavers' first big hit, the flipside of Lead Belly's ""Good Night Irene"", and a top seller in its own right, was in Hebrew (""Tzena, Tzena, Tzena"") and they, and later Joan Baez, who was of Mexican descent, occasionally included Spanish-language material in their repertoires, as well as songs from Africa, India, and elsewhere.

The commercially oriented folk-music revival as it existed in coffee houses, concert halls, radio, and TV was predominantly an English-language phenomenon, though many of the major pop-folk groups, such as the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Limeliters, The Brothers Four, The Highwaymen, and others, featured songs in Spanish (often from Mexico), Polynesian languages, Russian, French, and other languages in their recordings and performances. These groups also sang many English-language songs of foreign origin.

The British Invasion of the mid-1960s helped bring an end to the mainstream popularity of American folk music as a wave of British bands overwhelmed most of the American music scene, including folk. Ironically, the roots of the British Invasion were in American folk, specifically a variant known as skiffle as popularized by Lonnie Donegan; however, most of the British Invasion bands had been extensively influenced by rock and roll by the time their music had reached the United States and bore little resemblance to its folk origins.

After Bob Dylan began to record with a rocking rhythm section and electric instruments in 1965 (see Electric Dylan controversy), many other still-young folk artists followed suit. Meanwhile, bands like The Lovin' Spoonful and the Byrds, whose individual members often had a background in the folk-revival coffee-house scene, were getting recording contracts with folk-tinged music played with a rock-band line-up. Before long, the public appetite for the more acoustic music of the folk revival began to wane.

""Crossover"" hits (""folk songs"" that became rock-music-scene staples) happened now and again.  One well-known example is the song ""Hey Joe"", copyrighted by folk artist Billy Roberts and recorded by rock singer/guitarist Jimi Hendrix just as he was about to burst into stardom in 1967.  The anthem ""Woodstock"", which was written and first sung by Joni Mitchell while her records were still nearly entirely acoustic and while she was labeled a ""folk singer"", became a hit single for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young when the group recorded a full-on rock version.

By the late 1960s, the scene had returned to being more of a lower-key, aficionado phenomenon, although sizable annual acoustic-music festivals were established in many parts of North America during this period. The acoustic music coffee-house scene survived at a reduced scale. Through the luminary young singer-songwriters of the 1960s, the American folk-music revival has influenced songwriting and musical styles throughout the world."
"Folk rock","

Folk rock is a genre of rock music with heavy influences from English folk and American folk music.[1] Combining the elements of folk and rock music, it arose in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s.[2][3] In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the folk music revival. Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds—several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles—attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire, adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community. The term ""folk rock"" was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music.

The commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as Simon & Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.

During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock.

The term ""folk rock"" refers to the blending of elements of folk music and rock music, which arose in the U.S. and UK in the mid-1960s.[2] The genre was pioneered by the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands.[4][5] The term ""folk rock"" was initially coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued.[6][7] Dylan also contributed to the creation of the genre, with his recordings utilizing rock instrumentation on the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde.[8]

In a broader sense, folk rock encompasses similarly inspired musical genres and movements in different regions of the world. Folk rock may lean more towards either folk or rock in instrumentation, playing and vocal style, and choice of material. While the original genre draws on music of Europe and North America, there is no clear delineation of which other culture's music might be included as influences.

The American folk-music revival began during the 1940s; building on the interest in protest folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, it reached a peak in popularity in the mid-1960s with artists such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez.[10][11] In 1948, Seeger formed the Weavers, whose mainstream popularity set the stage for the folk revival of the 1950s and early 1960s and also served to bridge the gap between folk, popular music, and topical song.[12] The Weavers' sound and repertoire of traditional folk material and topical songs directly inspired the Kingston Trio, a three-piece folk group who came to prominence in 1958 with their hit recording of ""Tom Dooley"".[12][13] The Kingston Trio provided the template for a flood of ""collegiate folk"" groups between 1958 and 1962.[14][15].mw-parser-output .side-box{margin:4px 0;box-sizing:border-box;border:1px solid #aaa;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em;background-color:#f9f9f9;display:flow-root}.mw-parser-output .side-box-abovebelow,.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{padding:0.25em 0.9em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-image{padding:2px 0 2px 0.9em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-imageright{padding:2px 0.9em 2px 0;text-align:center}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .side-box-flex{display:flex;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{flex:1;min-width:0}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .side-box{width:238px}.mw-parser-output .side-box-right{clear:right;float:right;margin-left:1em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-left{margin-right:1em}}.mw-parser-output .listen .side-box-text{line-height:1.1em}.mw-parser-output .listen-plain{border:none;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded{width:100%;margin:0;border-width:1px 0 0 0;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-header{padding:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded .listen-header{padding:2px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen-file-header{padding:4px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen .description{padding-top:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen .mw-tmh-player{max-width:100%}@media(max-width:719px){.mw-parser-output .listen{clear:both}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .listen:not(.listen-noimage){width:320px}.mw-parser-output .listen-left{overflow:visible;float:left}.mw-parser-output .listen-center{float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}}

At roughly the same time as these ""collegiate folk"" vocal groups came to national prominence, a second group of urban folk revivalists, influenced by the music and guitar picking styles of folk and blues artist such as Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Brownie McGhee, and Josh White, also came to the fore.[16] Many of these urban revivalists were influenced by recordings of traditional American music from the 1920s and 1930s, which had been reissued by Folkways Records; Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music was particularly influential.[16][17] While this urban folk revival flourished in many cities, New York City, with its burgeoning Greenwich Village coffeehouse scene and population of topical folk singers, was widely regarded as the centre of the movement.[16][18] Out of this fertile environment came such folk-protest luminaries as Bob Dylan,[19]Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, and Peter, Paul and Mary,[20] many of whom would transition into folk rock performers as the 1960s progressed.[16]

The vast majority of the urban folk revivalists shared a disdain for the values of mainstream American mass culture[21] and led many folk singers to begin composing their own ""protest"" material.[22][23] The influence of this folk-protest movement would later manifest itself in the sociopolitical lyrics and mildly anti-establishment sentiments of many folk rock songs, including hit singles such as ""Eve of Destruction"", ""Like a Rolling Stone"", ""For What It's Worth"", and ""Let's Live for Today"".

During the 1950s and early 1960s in the UK, a parallel folk revival referred to as the second British folk revival, was led by folk singers Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd.[24] Both viewed British folk music as a vehicle for leftist political concepts and an antidote to the American-dominated popular music of the time.[24][25] However, it was not until 1956 and the advent of the skiffle craze that the British folk revival crossed over into the mainstream and connected with British youth culture.[24][26] Skiffle renewed popularity of folk music forms in Britain and led directly to the progressive folk movement and the attendant British folk club scene.[24] Among the leading lights of the progressive folk movement were Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who would later form the folk rock band Pentangle in the late 1960s.[27] Other notable folk rock artists with roots in the progressive folk scene were Donovan, Al Stewart, John Martyn and Paul Simon.[28][29][self-published source?]

They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid. You could only do that with other musicians. Even if you're playing your own chords you had to have other people playing with you. That was obvious. And it started me thinking about other people.

—Bob Dylan reflecting on how the Beatles influenced his decision to record with an electric backing band[30]

Beginning in 1964 and lasting until roughly 1966, a wave of British beat groups, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Kinks, and Herman's Hermits amongst others, dominated the U.S. music charts.[31][32] These groups were all heavily influenced by American rock 'n' roll, blues, and R&B—musical genres they had been introduced to via homegrown British rock 'n' roll singers, imported American records, and the music of the skiffle craze.[31][33] These UK groups, known collectively as the British Invasion, reintroduced American youth culture to the broad potential of rock and pop music as a creative medium and to the wealth of musical culture to be found within the United States.

Of particular importance to the development of folk rock by the British Invasion were the subtle folk influences evident in such Beatles' compositions as ""I'll Be Back"", ""Things We Said Today"", and ""I'm a Loser"",[34] with the latter song being directly inspired by folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan.[35] In the opinion of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, writers who attempt to define the origins of folk rock ""don't realise that the Beatles were responsible as far back as 1963"". He cites ""She Loves You"" as one of the first examples where the Beatles introduced folk chord changes into rock music and so initiated the new genre.[36] These songs were all influential in providing a template for successfully assimilating folk-based chord progressions and melodies into pop music. This melding of folk and rock 'n' roll in the Beatles' music became even more explicit during 1965, with the release of ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"", a folk-derived song with introspective lyrics, again influenced by Dylan.[37][38] Although the Beatles themselves utilized folk as just one of many styles evident in their music, the underlying folk influences in a number of their songs would prove to be important to folk rock musicians attempting to blend their own folk influences with beat music.

The effect that the music of these British bands, and the Beatles in particular, had on young Americans was immediate; almost overnight, folk—along with many other forms of homegrown music—became passé for a large proportion of America's youth, who instead turned their attention to the influx of British acts.[33][39] The influence of these acts also impacted on the collegiate folk and urban folk communities, with many young musicians quickly losing interest in folk music and instead embracing the rock 'n' roll derived repertoire of the British Invasion.[39] Future members of many folk rock acts, including the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, and Buffalo Springfield, all turned their backs on traditional folk music during 1964 and 1965 as a direct result of the influence of the Beatles and the other British Invasion bands. Author and music historian Richie Unterberger has noted that the Beatles' impact on American popular culture effectively sounded the death knell for the American folk music revival.[39]

In addition to The Beatles, the two British groups that were arguably the most influential on the development of folk rock were the Animals and the Searchers. The Animals released a rock interpretation of the traditional folk song ""The House of the Rising Sun"" in the U.S. in August 1964. The song reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and stayed there for three weeks, selling over a million copies in just five weeks in the U.S.[40] The band's arrangement of ""The House of the Rising Sun"", which transmuted the song from an acoustic folk lament to a full-bore electric rock song, would go on to influence many folk rock acts but none more so than Dylan himself, who cited it as a key factor in his decision to record and perform with an electric rock band in 1965.[41]

The Searchers were influential in popularizing the jangly sound of the electric twelve-string guitar.[42][43] Many musicians in the collegiate and urban folk movements were already familiar with acoustic twelve-string guitars via the music of folk and blues singer Lead Belly. However, the Searchers' use of amplified twelve-strings provided another example of how conventional folk elements could be incorporated into rock music to produce new and exciting sounds. The Beatles' lead guitarist, George Harrison, also influenced this trend towards jangly guitars in folk rock with his use of a Rickenbacker twelve-string guitar on the Beatles' mid-1960s recordings. This relatively clean, jangly sound—without distortion or other guitar effects—became a cornerstone of folk rock instrumentation and was used in many American folk rock records made during 1965 and 1966.[citation needed]

We were a group, but not professional musicians. I had to de-complicate my music and get it simpler and simpler, so that we could play it and make it sound like a popular thing. Whenever you have a format like that, it sounds folky, because it's not glitzed over with anything. We only had acoustic and electric guitars, so every chance we got, we'd try to add some variety. The only way you could get variety was to go to a harmonica during this song, or get an acoustic in this space; get different moods that way.

—Ron Elliott of The Beau Brummels on the origins of the band's folk-flavored sound

Although folk rock mainly grew out of a mix of American folk revival and British Invasion influences,[10] there were also a few examples of proto-folk rock that were important in the development of the genre. Of these secondary influences, Unterberger has cited the self-penned, folk-influenced material of San Francisco's the Beau Brummels as arguably the most important. Despite their Beatlesque image, the band's use of minor chords, haunting harmonies, and folky acoustic guitar playing—as heard on their debut single ""Laugh, Laugh""—was stylistically very similar to the later folk rock of the Byrds.[44][nb 1] Released in December 1964, ""Laugh, Laugh"" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1965, while its similarly folk-flavored follow-up, ""Just a Little"", did even better, reaching number 8 on the U.S. singles chart.[44][45][46] The high-profile success of the Beau Brummels' music was important in demonstrating that a hybrid of folk and rock could potentially be translated into mainstream commercial success.[44]

Pre-dating the Beau Brummels' commercial breakthrough by almost two years, singer-songwriter Jackie DeShannon's April 1963 single ""Needles and Pins"" marked, according to Unterberger, the earliest appearance of the ringing guitar sound that would become a mainstay of early folk rock.[34] This use of cyclical, chiming guitar riffs was repeated on DeShannon's late 1963 recording of her own composition ""When You Walk in the Room"".[34] The following year, both songs would become hits for the Liverpudlian band the Searchers, who chose to place even greater emphasis on the jangly guitar playing in the songs.[34] In addition, a number of DeShannon's songs from the period, including ""When You Walk in the Room"", displayed a greater degree of lyrical maturity and sensuality than was usual for pop songs of the time.[34] This heightened degree of emotional introspection was inspired by her love of Bob Dylan's folk songwriting and represents one of the first attempts by an American artist to absorb folk sensibilities into rock music.[34]

In the UK, the folk group the Springfields (featuring Dusty Springfield) had been releasing folk-oriented material featuring full band arrangements since the early 1960s, including renditions of ""Lonesome Traveler"", ""Allentown Jail"", and ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"".[47] Although these records owed more to orchestral pop than rock, they were nonetheless influential on up-and-coming folk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic.[47] In mid-1965, folk singer-songwriter Donovan was also experimenting with adding electrified instrumentation to some of his folk and blues-styled material, as evidenced by songs such as ""You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond"" and ""Sunny Goodge Street"".[48] In spite of his folky persona and repertoire, Donovan himself had always considered himself a pop star, rather than a folk singer.[49] As a result, he had been thinking of a way in which to introduce folk styled acoustic guitars and socially conscious lyrics into pop music for several years prior to his 1965 breakthrough as a recording artist.[49] By January 1966, he had recorded the self-penned hit ""Sunshine Superman"" with a full electric backing band.[50][51]

Other bands and solo artists who were blurring the boundaries between folk and rock in the early 1960s include Judy Henske,[52]Richard and Mimi Fariña,[53] and the Mugwumps, the latter of which were a New York band featuring future members of the Lovin' Spoonful and the Mamas & the Papas.[54] Also of note are the Australian band the Seekers, who had relocated to England in 1964 and reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart with ""I'll Never Find Another You"" in February 1965.[55][56] Unterberger has noted that, although it was not strictly a folk song, ""I'll Never Find Another You"" was heavily influenced by Peter, Paul and Mary and featured a cyclical, twelve-string guitar part that sounded similar to the guitar style that Jim McGuinn of the Byrds would popularize later that same year.[49][57]

There are also a few antecedents to folk rock present in pre-British Invasion American rock 'n' roll, including Elvis Presley's 1954 cover of the Bill Monroe bluegrass standard ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"";[58]Buddy Holly's self-penned material, which strongly influenced both Dylan and the Byrds;[58][59]Ritchie Valens' recording of the Mexican folk song ""La Bamba"";[58]Lloyd Price's rock 'n' roll adaptation of the African-American folk song ""Stagger Lee"" (originally recorded by Mississippi John Hurt in 1928);[58][60]Jimmie Rodgers' rock 'n' roll flavored renditions of traditional folk songs;[61] and the folk and country-influenced recordings featured on the Everly Brothers' 1959 album Songs Our Daddy Taught Us.[58]

The moment when all of the separate influences that served to make up folk rock finally coalesced into an identifiable whole was with the release of the Byrds' recording of Bob Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"".[8][62][63][64] The term ""folk rock"" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the band's sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard chart.[6][7][65] Within three months it had become the first folk rock smash hit,[66] reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.[67][68] The single's success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a profusion of Byrds-influenced acts flooded the American and British charts.[8][62][nb 2] In particular, the Byrds' influence can be discerned in mid-1960s recordings by acts such as the Lovin' Spoonful, Barry McGuire, the Mamas & the Papas,[65]Simon & Garfunkel,[77]Jefferson Airplane, the Turtles, We Five, Love, and Sonny & Cher.[8][62][78][79][80][text–source integrity?]

It was during the rehearsals at World Pacific that the band began to develop the blend of folk music and Beatles-style pop that would characterize their sound.[81] However, this hybrid was not deliberately created; it evolved organically out of some of the band members' own folk music roots and their desire to emulate the Beatles.[74] The band's folk influences, lack of experience with rock music forms, and Beatleseque instrumentation all combined to color both their self-penned material and their folk derived repertoire.[8][74][82] The band themselves soon realized that there was something unique about their music and, with Dickson's encouragement, they began to actively attempt to bridge the gap between folk and rock.[74][83]

Mr. Tambourine Man's blend of abstract lyrics, folk-influenced melody, complex harmonies, jangly 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing, and Beatles-influenced beat, resulted in a synthesis that effectively created the subgenre of folk rock.[70][84] The song's lyrics alone took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary lyrics been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.[85]

Dylan's material would provide much of the original grist for the folk rock mill, not only in the U.S. but in the UK as well, with many pop and rock acts covering his material in a style reminiscent of the Byrds.[62] Their reworking of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", along with the Animals' rock interpretation of ""The House of the Rising Sun"" (itself based on Dylan's earlier cover), helped to give Dylan the impetus to start recording with an electric backing band.[86]

As the 1970s dawned, folk rock evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by the Byrds, but their influence could still be heard in the music of bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle.[4][8][87] The Byrds themselves continued to enjoy commercial success with their brand of folk rock throughout 1965, most notably with their number 1 single ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"".[65]  By the start of 1966, however, the group had begun to move away from folk rock and into the new musical frontier of psychedelic rock. The folk rock sound of the Byrds has continued to influence many bands over the years, including Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Long Ryders, the Smiths, the Bangles, the Stone Roses, and Teenage Fanclub, among others.[88]

Five days before the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record his song ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", Bob Dylan completed the recording sessions for his fifth album, Bringing It All Back Home.[89] Of the eleven tracks on the album, seven featured Dylan backed by a full electric rock band, in stark contrast to his earlier acoustic folk albums.[89] Dylan's decision to record with an electric backing band had been influenced by a number of factors, including the Beatles' coupling of folk derived chord progressions and beat music, the Byrds' rock adaptation of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" (which Dylan had heard at a Byrds' rehearsal in late 1964), and the Animals hit cover of ""The House of the Rising Sun"".[41][90][91]

Bringing It All Back Home was released on 22 March 1965,[92] peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and #1 on the UK Album Chart.[93][94] The album's blend of rhythm and blues-derived rock and abstract, poetic lyrics was immediately influential in demonstrating that intelligent lyrical content could be wedded with rock 'n' roll.[95] The songs on the album saw Dylan leaving folk music far behind.[96] Even with this folkier, acoustic material, Dylan's biting, apocalyptical, and often humorous lyrics went far beyond those of contemporary folk music,[96] particularly the folk-protest music with which he had been previously associated.

On 20 July 1965, Dylan released the groundbreaking ""Like a Rolling Stone"", a six-minute-long scathing put-down, directed at a down-and-out society girl, which again featured Dylan backed by an electric rock band.[97][98] Released just as the Byrds' cover of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" topped the charts in the United States, the song was instrumental in defining the burgeoning folk rock scene and in establishing Dylan as a bona fide rock star, rather than a folksinger.[97] ""Like a Rolling Stone"" managed to reach the Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic.[94][99] Five days after the release of ""Like a Rolling Stone"", on 25 July 1965, Dylan made a controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, performing three songs with a full band.[97] He was met with derisive booing and jeering from the festival's purist folk music crowd,[100] but in the years since the incident, Dylan's 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the synthesis of folk and rock.[97][101][102]

Dylan followed ""Like a Rolling Stone"" with the wholly electric album Highway 61 Revisited and the non-album single ""Positively 4th Street"", which itself has been widely interpreted as a rebuke to the folk purists who had rejected his new electric music. Throughout 1965 and 1966, hit singles like ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", ""Like a Rolling Stone"", ""Positively 4th Street"", and ""I Want You"" among others, along with the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums, proved to be hugely influential on the development and popularity of folk rock.[103] Although Dylan's move away from acoustic folk music served to outrage and alienate much of his original fanbase, his new folk rock sound gained him legions of new fans during the mid-1960s. The popularity and commercial success of the Byrds and Bob Dylan's blend of folk and rock music influenced a wave of imitators and emulators that retroactively became known as the folk rock boom.[8]

Although he started out as a jazz musician, the young, African-American Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson became known as the ""mid-wife of folk-rock"" for his seminal work behind the scenes. As Bob Dylan's producer during the key transitional albums The Times They Are A-Changin, Another Side of Bob Dylan, and Bringing It All Back Home, he was a key architect of Dylan's electric sound. He is perhaps even better known, however, for first discovering Simon & Garfunkel at the tail end of the folk movement and then transforming them into folk-rock superstars with the unauthorized rock remix that made a number one hit out of their previously underappreciated song, ""The Sound of Silence"".[104][105]

Music critic Richie Unterberger has noted that the commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", along with Dylan's own contributions to the genre on the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde, initiated an explosion of emulators and imitators.[8][62] Their success led record producer Tom Wilson to add electric guitar, bass, and drums overdubs to ""The Sounds of Silence"", a song which had been recorded by the folk duo Simon & Garfunkel in 1964 and first released on their album Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. The reissued single rose to number 1 on the Billboard pop chart in late 1965, became a hit around the world, and set the duo on one of the most successful careers in pop and rock music.[77]  Simon and Garfunkel have been described as ""folk-rock's greatest duo, and one whose fame and influence would persist well beyond folk-rock's heyday.""[106]

One of the first bands to craft a distinctly American sound in response to the British Invasion was the Beach Boys; while not a folk rock band themselves, they directly influenced the genre and at the height of the folk rock boom in 1966 had a hit with a cover of the 1920s West Indian folk song ""Sloop John B"", which they had learned from the Kingston Trio, who had learned it from the Weavers.[107]

Much of the early folk-rock music emerged during a time of general global upheaval, the Vietnam War, and new concerns for the world by young people. In the United States, the heyday of folk rock was arguably between the mid-sixties and the mid-seventies, when it aligned itself with the hippie movement and became an important medium for expressing radical ideas. Cities such as San Francisco, Denver, New York City and Phoenix became centers for the folk rock culture, playing on their central locations among the original folk circuits. The ""unplugged"" and simplified sound of the music reflected the genre's connection to a critical view of a technological and consumerist society. Unlike pop music's escapist lyrics, arguably a fantasy distraction from the problems in life, folk artists attempted to communicate concerns for peace, global awareness, and other touchstones of the era. Bands whose music was significantly folk rock in sound during the mid-to-late 1960s included Donovan,[108]the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas,[65]the Youngbloods, Love, and, in their early years, Jefferson Airplane.

In the mid-1960s, singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot began moving his folk songs into a folk-rock direction with recordings such as the percussion-driven ""Black Day in July"" about the 1967 Detroit riot. He would rise to top the charts in the 1970s with a number of his folk-rock recordings such as ""Sundown"" and ""Carefree Highway"" and eventually become known as a folk-rock legend.[109] Some artists who originally produced with a harder edged rock sound found the ability to communicate more easily and felt more genuine in this method of delivery. In this category was Cat Stevens, who began in London much like the Byrds did in the United States but toned down the sound more frequently with acoustic instruments. He performed songs that contained concern for the environment, war, and the future of the world in general. The Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell won many Grammy Awards with her folk rock/pop songs.

British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle.[110][111] It uses traditional British music and self-penned compositions in a traditional style, and is played on a combination of traditional and rock instruments.[112] This incorporation of traditional British folk music influences gives British folk rock its distinctly British character and flavour.[110] It evolved out of the psychedelia-influenced folk rock of British acts such as Donovan, the Incredible String Band, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, but was also heavily influenced by such American folk rock bands as the Byrds, Love, and Buffalo Springfield.[111] British folk rock was at its most significant and popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, when, in addition to Fairport and Pentangle, it was taken up by groups such as Steeleye Span and the Albion Band.[27][113]

Steeleye Span, founded by Fairport Convention bass player Ashley Hutchings, was made up of traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate electrical amplification, and later overt rock elements, into their music.[114] This, in turn, spawned the conspicuously English folk rock music of the Albion Band, a group that also included Hutchings.[115] In Brittany folk rock was developed by Alan Stivell (who began to mix his Breton, Irish, and Scottish roots with rock music) and later by French bands like Malicorne.[116][117] During this same period, folk rock was adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives.[118][117]

A subgenre originally arising from the early 1960s folk and country-influenced music of singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Bare, as well as from folk revivalist vocal groups like the Kingston Trio.[119][120][121] During the late 1960s, many folk rock artists including Dylan, Ian and Sylvia, and the Byrds began to incorporate a strong country influence into their music, drawing heavily on Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens amongst others, resulting in the concurrent offshoot of country rock.[122][123] This successful blending of country, folk and rock styles led to pioneering country folk records by folk-influenced singer-songwriters such as John Denver and Neil Young during the 1970s.[124] Country folk music usually displays a softer, more ""laid-back"" feel than the majority of country music and is often complemented by introspective lyrics, thus preserving its folk singer-songwriter roots.[119] Since the 1970s, the country folk subgenre has been perpetuated by artists including John Prine, Nanci Griffith, Kathy Mattea, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Iris DeMent.[125][126]

A subgenre of folk rock that combines traditional Celtic instrumentation with rock rhythms, often influenced by a wide variety of pop and rock music styles.[127] It emerged from the electric folk music of the late 1960s and was pioneered by bands such as Horslips, who blended Gaelic mythology, traditional Irish music and rock.[118] The British singer-songwriter Donovan was also influential in developing Celtic rock during the late 1960s, with his albums The Hurdy Gurdy Man, Barabajagal, and Open Road, the latter of which actually featured a song entitled ""Celtic Rock"".[128][129]

The subgenre was further popularised in 1973 by Thin Lizzy, who had a hit with ""Whiskey in the Jar"", a traditional Irish song performed entirely in the rock idiom.[118][130] Throughout the 1970s, Celtic rock held close to its folk roots, drawing heavily on traditional Celtic fiddle, pipe, and harp tunes, as well as traditional vocal styles, but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion.[118][131] In the 1980s and beyond, Celtic rock was perpetuated by bands such as the Pogues, the Waterboys, Runrig, Black 47, and the Prodigals. A more recent folk rock band based in England is the BibleCode Sundays.[127][132] Celtic rock is also popular in Spain where bands such as Celtas Cortos have had a large following since the early 1990s.

Medieval folk rock developed as a subgenre of electric folk from about 1970 as performers, particularly in England, Germany and Brittany, adopted medieval and renaissance music as a basis for their music, in contrast to the early modern and nineteenth century ballads that dominated the output of Fairport Convention. This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span, and exemplified by their 1972 album Below the Salt. Acts in this area included Gryphon, Gentle Giant and Third Ear Band.[133] In Germany Ougenweide, originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German electric folk.[134] In Brittany, as part of the Celtic rock movement, medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from 1977 and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from 1979.[135] However, by the end of the 1970s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved, like Gentle Giant and Gryphon, into the developing area of progressive rock.[136][self-published source?] In the 1990s, as part of the wider resurgence of folk music in general, new medieval folk rock acts began to appear, including the Ritchie Blackmore project Blackmore's Night, German bands such as In Extremo, Subway to Sally or Schandmaul and English bands like Circulus.[137]

In Britain the tendency to electrify brought several progressive folk acts into rock.[138] This includes the acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, who became the electric combo T. Rex.[139] Others, probably influenced by the electric folk pioneered by Fairport Convention from 1969, moved towards more traditional material, a category including Dando Shaft, Amazing Blondel, and Jack the Lad, an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne, who were one of the most successful UK bands of the early 1970s.[140] Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived (but later reunited) Comus and, more successfully, Renaissance, who combined folk and rock with elements of classical music.[141]

Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.

The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England, Cruachan from Ireland and Mago de Oz from Spain. Skyclad's debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan's early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.

The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy, mythology, paganism, history and nature.

"Celtic rock","Celtic rock is a genre of folk rock, as well as a form of Celtic fusion which incorporates Celtic music, instrumentation and themes into a rock music context. It has been prolific since the early 1970s and can be seen as a key foundation of the development of successful mainstream Celtic bands and popular musical performers, as well as creating important derivatives through further fusions. It has played a major role in the maintenance and definition of regional and national identities and in fostering a pan-Celtic culture. It has also helped to communicate those cultures to external audiences.[1]

The style of music is the hybrid of traditional Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Breton musical forms with rock music.[2] This has been achieved by the playing of traditional music, particularly ballads, jigs and reels with rock instrumentation; by the addition of traditional Celtic instruments, including the Celtic harp, tin whistle, uilleann pipes (or Irish Bagpipes), fiddle, bodhrán, accordion, concertina, melodeon, and bagpipes (highland) to conventional rock formats; by the use of lyrics in Celtic languages and by the use of traditional rhythms and cadences in otherwise conventional rock music.[3] Just as the validity of the term Celtic in general and as a musical label is disputed, the term Celtic rock cannot be taken to mean there was a unified Celtic musical culture between the Celtic nations. However, the term has remained useful as a means of describing the spread, adaptation and further development of the musical form in different but related contexts.

It was in Ireland that Celtic rock was first clearly evident as musicians attempted to apply the use of traditional and electric music to their own cultural context. By the end of the 1960s Ireland already had perhaps the most flourishing folk music tradition and a growing blues and pop scene, which provided a basis for Irish rock. Perhaps the most successful product of this scene was the band Thin Lizzy. Formed in 1969 their first two albums were recognisably influenced by traditional Irish music and their first hit single ""Whisky in the Jar"" in 1972, was a rock version of a traditional Irish song.[4] From this point they began to move towards the hard rock that allowed them to gain a series of hit singles and albums, but retained some occasional elements of Celtic rock on later albums such as Jailbreak (1976).

Formed in 1970, Horslips were the first Irish group to have the terms 'Celtic rock' applied to them, and produced work that included traditional Irish/Celtic music and instrumentation, Celtic themes and imagery, and concept albums based on Irish mythology in a way that entered the territory of progressive rock all powered by a hard rock sound.[5] Horslips are considered important in the history of Irish rock as they were the first major band to enjoy success without having to leave their native country and can be seen as providing a template for Celtic rock in Ireland and elsewhere.[6] These developments ran in parallel with the burgeoning folk revival in Ireland that included groups such as Planxty and the Bothy Band.[7] It was from this tradition that Clannad, whose first album was released in 1973, adopted electric instruments and a more 'new age' sound at the beginning of the 1980s.[8]Moving Hearts, formed in 1981 by former Planxty members Christy Moore and Donal Lunny, followed the pattern set by Horslips in combining Irish traditional music with rock, and also added elements of jazz to their sound.[9]

There were already strong links between Irish and Scottish music by the 1960s, with Irish bands like the Chieftains touring and outselling the native artists in Scotland. The adoption of folk rock produced groups including the JSD Band and Spencer's Feat. Out of the wreckage of the latter in 1974, was formed probably the most successful band in this genre, combining Irish and Scottish personnel to form Five Hand Reel.[10] Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s emerged from the dance band circuit in Scotland. From 1978, when they began to release original albums, Runrig produced highly polished Scottish folk rock, including the first commercially successful album with the all Gaelic Play Gaelic in 1978.[11] From the 1980s Capercaillie combined Scottish folk music, electric instruments and haunting vocals to considerable success.[12] Scottish Band The Waterboys became a well known Celtic Rock band during the 80s with the release of albums such as This Is The Sea and Fisherman's Blues. They also incorporated folk elements into their music. One of Scotland's most commercially successful and fondly-remembered rock acts, Big Country, also incorporated the influence of traditional Scottish music into their songs. While bagpipes had become an essential element in Scottish folk bands they were much rarer in folk rock outfits, but were successfully integrated into their sound by Wolfstone from 1989, who focused on a combination of highland music and rock.[13]

The region of Brittany also made a major contribution to Celtic rock. The Breton cultural revival of the 1960s was exemplified by Alan Stivell who became the leading proponent of the Breton harp and other instruments from about 1960, he then adopted elements of Irish, Welsh and Scottish traditional music in an attempt to create a pan-Celtic folk music, which had considerable impact elsewhere, particularly in Wales and Cornwall.[14] From 1972 he began to play folk rock with a band including guitarists Dan Ar Braz and Gabriel Yacoub. Yacoub went on to form Malicorne in 1974 one of the most successful folk rock bands in France. After an extensive career that included a stint playing as part of Fairport Convention in 1976, Ar Braz formed the pan-Celtic band Heritage des Celtes, who managed to achieve mainstream success in France in the 1990s. Probably the best known and most enduring folk rock band in France were Tri Yann formed in 1971 and still recording and performing today.[15]

By the end of the 1960s Wales had produced some important individuals and bands that emerged as major British or international artists, this included power pop outfit Badfinger, psychedelic rockers Elastic Band and proto-heavy metal trio Budgie. But although folk groupings formed in the early 1970s, including Y Tebot Piws, Ac Eraill, and Mynediad am Ddim, it was not until 1973 that the first significant Welsh language rock band Edward H Dafis, originally a belated rock n' roll outfit, caused a sensation by electrifying and attempting to use rock instrumentation while retaining Welsh language lyrics.[16] As a result, for one generation listening to Welsh language rock music could now become a statement of national identity.[17] This opened the door for a new rock culture but inevitably most Welsh language acts were unable to break through into the Anglophone dominated music industry.[18]

Whereas other Celtic nations already had existing folk music cultures before the end of the 1960s this was less true in Cornwall and the Isle of Man, which were also relatively small in population and more integrated into English culture and (in the case of Cornwall) the British State. As a result, there was relatively little impact from the initial wave of folk electrification in the 1970s. However, the pan-Celtic movement, with its musical and cultural festivals helped foster some reflections in Cornwall where a few bands from the 1980s onwards utilised the traditions of Cornish music with rock, including Moondragon and its successor Lordryk. More recently the bands Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have been performing in the Cornish language.[19]

Ireland proved particularly fertile ground for punk bands in the mid-1970s, including Stiff Little Fingers, The Undertones, The Radiators From Space, The Boomtown Rats and The Virgin Prunes. Scotland also produced its fair share with acts including The Skids and The Rezillos. As with folk rock in England, the advent of punk and other musical trends undermined the folk element of Celtic rock, but in the early 1980s London based Irish band The Pogues created the subgenre Celtic punk by combining structural elements of folk music with a punk attitude and delivery. The Pogues' style of punked-up Irish music spawned and influenced a number of Celtic punk bands, including fellow London-Irish band Neck, Nyah Fearties from Scotland, Australia's Roaring Jack and Norway's Greenland Whalefishers.

One by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. While it seems young musicians from these communities usually chose between their folk culture and mainstream forms of music such as rock or pop, after the advent of Celtic punk relatively large numbers of bands began to emerge styling themselves as Celtic rock. This is particularly noticeable in the US and Canada, where there are large communities descended from Irish and Scottish immigrants. From the United States this includes the Irish bands Flogging Molly, The Tossers, Dropkick Murphys, The Young Dubliners, LeperKhanz, Black 47, The Killdares, The Drovers and Jackdaw, and for Scottish bands Prydein, Seven Nations and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands like The Mahones, Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West. These groups were naturally influenced by American forms of music, some containing members with no Celtic ancestry and commonly singing in English. A band in England is the BibleCode Sundays.[20]

Like Celtic rock in the 1970s, Celtic metal resulted from the application of a development in English music, when in the 1990s thrash metal band Skyclad added violins, and with them jigs and folk voicings, to their music on the album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth (1990). This inspired the Dublin based band Cruachan to mix traditional Irish music with black metal and to create the subgenre of Celtic metal. They were soon followed by bands such as Primordial and Waylander. Like Celtic punk, Celtic metal replicates the fusing the Celtic folk tradition with contemporary forms of music.

Whereas in England folk rock, after initial mainstream recognition, subsided into the status of a sub-cultural soundtrack, in many Celtic communities and nations it has remained at the forefront of musical production. The initial wave of Celtic rock in Ireland, although ultimately feeding into Anglo-American dominated progressive rock and hard rock provided a basis for Irish bands that would enjoy international success, including the Pogues and U2: one making use of the tradition of Celtic music in a new context and the other eschewing it for a distinctive but mainstream sound. Similar circumstances can be seen in Scotland albeit with a delay in time while Celtic rock culture developed, before bands like Runrig could achieve international recognition. Widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding voices in Celtic/rock is Brian McCombe (born Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom) of The Brian McCombe Band, a pan Celtic group based in Brittany.[citation needed]

In other Celtic communities, and particularly where Celtic speakers or descendants are a minority, the function of Celtic rock has been less to create mainstream success, than to bolster cultural identity. A consequence of this has been the reinforcement of pan-Celtic culture and of particular national or regional identities between those with a shared heritage, but who are widely dispersed. However, perhaps the most significant consequence of Celtic rock has simply been as a general spur to immense musical and cultural creativity.

Celtic rock has also influenced musicians from countries and regions without Celtic communities, with some of them, like the Balkans, spawning their own Celtic rock scenes, which contributed to the interest for Celtic music and culture in local public.[21] The pioneers of Celtic rock on the Yugoslav rock scene were the pub/garage rock band Roze Poze in the mid-1980s.[22] In the 1990s, bands like Orthodox Celts from Serbia[23] and Belfast Food from Croatia popularized Celtic rock further, influencing a number of younger acts, like Irish Stew of Sindidun."
"Indie folk","Indie folk is a music genre that arose in the 1990s among musicians from indie rock scenes influenced by folk music. Indie folk hybridizes the acoustic guitar melodies of traditional folk music with contemporary instrumentation.

The genre has its earliest origins in 1990s folk artists who displayed alternative rock influences in their music, such as Ani DiFranco and Dan Bern, and acoustic artists such as Elliott Smith and Will Oldham.[1][2] In the following decade, labels such as Saddle Creek, Barsuk, Ramseur, and Sub Pop helped to provide support to indie folk,[2] with artists such as Fleet Foxes breaking into the pop charts with albums such as Helplessness Blues.[3][4][5][6][7]

In the United Kingdom, artists such as Ben Howard[8][9][10][11] and Mumford & Sons[12][13][14] emerged, with the latter band promoting the music style through their Gentlemen of the Road touring festivals.[15][16][17] The success of acts like Mumford & Sons led some music journalists like Popjustice's Peter Robinson labelling this new British music scene as The New Boring or Beige Pop.[18][19][20][14] A decade later, the terms ""stomp and holler"", ""stomp clap hey"", and ""hoedown pop"" were coined to refer retrospectively to such bands.[21]

In the late 2010s, artists such as Phoebe Bridgers[22] and Julien Baker[23] revived interest in the genre. Bridgers cites Elliott Smith as a foundational influence on her sound.[24]"
"Mariachi","Mariachi (.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}US: /ˌmɑːriˈɑːtʃi/, UK: /ˌmær-/, Spanish: [maˈɾjatʃi]) is an ensemble of musicians that typically play ranchera, the regional Mexican music dating back to at least the 18th century, evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western Mexico.[1] The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched vihuela and an acoustic bass guitar called a guitarrón, and all players taking turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.

During the 19th- and 20th-century migrations from rural areas into Guadalajara, along with the Mexican government's promotion of national culture, mariachi came to be recognized as a distinctly Mexican son. Modifications of the music include influences from other music such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. In 2011, UNESCO recognized mariachi as an Intangible Cultural Heritage in hopes of being a protected element of heritage; it joins six other entries on the Mexican list of that category.[2]

Song styles performed with mariachi include rancheras, corridos, cumbias, boleros, ballads, sones, huapangos, jarabes, danzones, joropos, pasodobles, marches, polkas, waltzes and chotís. Most song lyrics are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes, and country life.

The origin of the word is disputed, but prominent theories attribute it to deep roots. One states that it comes from the name of the wood used to make the dance platform.[3][4] Another states that mariachi comes from the indigenous name of a tree called pilla or cirimo; yet another states that it came from an image locally called María H (pronounced Mari-Ache).[4][5]

The most distant reference documented are more than 100 certificates of baptisms, burials and marriages in which the Mariachi ranch appears, between 1832 and 1850. It was located near the river Santiago, in Nayarit.[6]

The word mariachi was once thought to have derived from the French word mariage (""marriage""), dating from the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s, related to the music's appearance at weddings. This was a common explanation on record jackets and travel brochures but was disproven with the appearance of documents that showed that the word existed before this invasion:[7] 
in 1981, a letter written by Catholic priest Cosme Santa Ana to the archbishop was discovered in the archives of a church, where he complains about the noise as well as the drinking and gambling antics of the ""mariachis"" and dated in 1852, long before the French occupation.[8]

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous music was played with rattles, drums, flutes, and conch-shell horns as part of religious celebrations. The Spanish introduced violins, guitars, harps, brass instruments, and woodwinds, which mostly replaced the native instruments. The Europeans introduced their instruments to use during Mass, but they were quickly adapted to secular events.[3][5] Indigenous and mestizo peoples learned to play and make these instruments, often giving them modified shapes and tunings. In addition to instruments, the Spanish introduced the concept of musical groups—which, in the colonial period, generally consisted of two violins, a harp, and various guitars. These groups were based upon mestizaje culture and gave rise to a number of folk musical styles in Mexico.[3]

One of these folk musical styles was the son. This music featured string instruments. Son music divided into various regional varieties; the variety popular in the Jalisco area was called son jalisciense, whose best known song, also referred to as ""the mariachi national anthem"",[9] is ""La Negra"".[10] Modern mariachi music developed from this son style, with mariachi as an alternative name for son jalisciense. Early mariachi players did not look like those of today; they played only string instruments such as guitars and harps and dressed in typical peasant clothing: white pants and shirts with huarache sandals.[5][10] Those who could play the son jalisciense/mariachi music could find work at haciendas at a higher rate than those who could not.[5]

The distinction of mariachi from the older son jalisciense occurred slowly sometime during the 19th century. The music originated in the center-west of Mexico. Most claims for its origin lie in the state of Jalisco but neighboring states of Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacán have also claimed it. However, by the late 19th century, the music was firmly centered in Jalisco.[11] Most legends put the origin of the modern mariachi in the town of Cocula, Jalisco.[3]

The distinction between son and modern mariachi comes from the modification of the music. By the end of the nineteenth century, the European art music tradition was firmly transplanted to Mexico, with opera, salon music, waltzes, and more written and performed both by Europeans and Mexicans in the country. One variety was the salon orchestras called orquestas típicas that performed in more rural settings, notably in traje de charro outfits. This use of the traje de charro outfit was repeated with urban mariachi in the 1920s.

The traje de charro outfit is widely considered to be one of the two major changes that occurred during the Golden Age, the other being the introduction of trumpets.[12] The traje de charro outfit was also used in the national Orquestra Típica Mexicana (""Mexican Typical Orchestra""), organized in 1884 by Carlo Curti, and touring the United States and Mexico as part of a presentation of nationalism for the Mexican president Porfirio Diaz.[13] Curti's Orquestra Típica Mexicana has been called the ""predecessor of the mariachi bands"".[14] Traje de charro is heavily inspired by cowboys and features very symbolic sombreros, tight fitting pants, ruffled shirts, and jackets with heavy embroidery and embellishments throughout all the pieces.[15]

After the Mexican Revolution, many haciendas had to let workers go, including mariachis. Groups began to wander and play for a fee, which obliged them to incorporate other music into their repertoires, including waltzes and polkas. It also required them to play in public venues. From the late 19th century to the 1930s, mariachi groups were semi-professional.[5]

In the early 20th-century United States, record companies began actively recording rural music in other parts of the world. One of these was a recording called Cuarteto Coculense by Columbia, Edison and Victor in 1908 and 1909, recognized as one of the ""first"" mariachi recordings. The music also gained attention in Mexico City when a wealthy hacienda family brought an early mariachi from Cocula to play for President Porfirio Díaz in 1905.[16]

The common perception of the music and look of mariachi developed in the 20th century, as the music was transformed from a regional rural folk music to an urban phenomenon that came to represent Mexico.[11]
The music was first introduced to Mexico City in 1905.[16] During this time, many farm workers moved to the city, including those from Jalisco, which settled around Plaza Garibaldi.[17] These mariachi musicians developed new practices, such as performances in plazas and restaurants. However, it also continued its more traditional venues such as serenades, and performances at major family events.

During this time, the Mexican government was heavily involved in cultural promotion as a way to create a unified Mexican identity after the end of the Mexican Revolution. One of these efforts was the promotion of mariachi as an international symbol of Mexican identity, first with radio and sound recordings and later with films.[18]

Mexico built a nationwide radio broadcasting network in the 1920s such as XEB and XEW, which began broadcasting mariachi music as a media production, rather than as a music for social events.[19] This music was already being modified in part due to the advent of sound recording. For example, most son jaliscense songs were longer than the standard three-and-a-half minutes of the then-standard 78 rpm record, forcing the shortening of tunes. Around the same time, the popularity of jazz and Cuban music introduced the trumpet into mariachi, pushing the violins into second place and in some cases, replacing the harp.[5]

The most prized of the mariachis remained those from the state of Jalisco, particularly the areas of Cocula and Tecalitlán. They represented Mexico to the people during the Independence Day celebrations in Mexico City in 1933 as well as during Lázaro Cárdenas' election campaign in 1936.[5]

The charro tradition was strong in Jalisco, especially in a region called Los Altos. After the Revolution, the charreada became a national sport in Mexico and rings were constructed specifically for them, followed by professional charro associations. With the breakup of the large haciendas, charros were no longer economically necessary but were used as a cultural ideal, especially by the film industry in the mid-20th century. The first charro movies date from the 1920s, but the first to sing mariachi was Tito Guízar in Allá en el Rancho Grande in 1936. The character was played by Jorge Negrete in films such as ¡Ay, Jalisco... no te rajes! and ¡Así se quiere en Jalisco! The main characters used his ability to sing mariachi as a way to show strength, virility, and aesthetic beauty.[19] Its use in film also made the music popular and a symbol of ethnic pride for Mexican Americans in the United States.

However, these films also promoted a negative perception of mariachi music. During the early 20th century, mariachi was seen as lower class, and belonging in bars. Films from this period associated the charros and mariachi music with machismo, womanizing and drinking, especially of tequila.[5] This perception would change in the latter half of the 20th century, but the music remains strongly associated with tequila.[5]

Mariachi music and musicians became more professional with more formal training starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s, principally due to the success of a major mariachi by the name of Mariachi Vargas. Their appearance in many films, backing many singing stars, and their hiring of formal musicians prompted other mariachis to do the same. The group also expanded, adding trumpets, violins and even a classical guitar to become a kind of orchestra, keeping the traditional son/mariachi base while integrating new musical ideas and styles.[3] Arrangers like Rubén Fuentes incorporated classical influence. One other innovation, in contrast to the machismo of the style, were the first female mariachi performers, Lola Beltrán and Lucha Villa. One night Mariachi Vargas put Beltrán on stage when she was a teenager. Her versions of ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" and ""Tres Dias"" are now considered classics.[10]

Many of the traditional sounds of Cocula were lost as mariachi groups incorporated other musical styles that were popular on the radio.[10] New influences have come into the tradition from the Mexican American community in the United States.[8] In both countries, however, the learning of traditional pieces and repertory is still stressed to form a base.[19]

The International Mariachi Festival in Guadalajara is an annual ten-day event that attracts more than 500 mariachis, who perform in concert halls and city streets. Past performers include Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán, Mariachi los Camperos (led by Nati Cano) and Mariachi América de Jesús Rodríguez de Hijar.[20]

In Mexico City, the center of mariachi music remains Garibaldi Plaza. Mariachi musicians fill the plaza to solicit gigs, from individual songs for passers-by to being hired for events such as weddings and baptisms. They even stand on Eje Central in front of the plaza to flag down passing cars. In 2010, the government renovated the plaza to make it more tourist-friendly, adding new paving, gardens, police, security cameras, painted facades, and a museum dedicated to mariachi and tequila. Although mariachis can be hired in Mexico City over the phone or on the internet, many people still prefer to come to the plaza, hear the musicians and haggle over the price. About 2,500 mariachis hold union cards to work in the plaza, but as many as 4,000 may circulate through on a busy weekend.[17]

The size of a mariachi group varies depending on the availability of musicians.[4] The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar. Traditional mariachi guitars include the vihuela, a high-pitched, round-backed guitar that provides rhythm, and a bass guitar called a guitarrón, which also provides rhythm. Sometimes a Mexican folk harp provides bass and ornaments the melody. All are Mexican variations of European instruments.[3][4] There is generally no lead singer as in other kinds of groups, with all players singing choruses and taking turns singing the lead. Often the lead singer is assigned to a certain song due to voice qualities. Mariachi vocalization shows influences from a number of styles such as bolero (a romantic style), huapango (using falsetto), son jalisciense (an aggressive style) and more. Voices must be strong to be heard over amplified instruments.[4] Vocal style emphasizes operatic qualities, and instrumental performance demonstrates a level of virtuosity that reflects advanced musical training. Historically, mariachi groups have been made up of men, but there is growing acceptance of female mariachis.[4]

As mariachi groups are expected to play requests, they may need to know hundreds of songs.[21] Most songs are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes and even animals and country life from the genre's origins as rural son music. One particularly famous song is ""La Cucaracha"" (""The Cockroach"").[5][21]

Most mariachi groups are associated with family and religious celebrations along with serenades. A serenade in the Mexican culture is used to profess your love or show admiration for a person. Mariachis are most widely known to serenade during birthday celebrations. One of the most common pieces played by mariachis is ""Las Mañanitas"", for birthdays and celebrations of patron saints.[3]

In Mexico, mariachi music can also be found as part of Catholic Mass. The Misa panamericana is a mariachi folk mass sung in Spanish with new arrangements of classic hymns such as ""Kyrie Eleison"". This innovation began in 1966 by Canadian priest Jean Marc Leclerc and it moved from a small church in Cuernacava in the 1960s to the Cuernavaca Cathedral.[3] Mariachi mass grew because it was heavily involved in community, and was spurred onwards by the Chicano movement, spreading from Mexico to the United States and onwards.[22]

Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán is recognized as the oldest mariachi ensemble, founded by Gaspar Vargas in the late 1890s.[3] They moved from Jalisco to Mexico City and performed for the inauguration of President Lázaro Cárdenas.[3] Mariachi Vargas became famous accompanying singers such as Luis Miguel, Lola Beltrán, and Pedro Infante.[23] Mariachi Vargas's first recording was in 1937, the same year they appeared in Asi es mi Tierra. They appeared in over 200 films in the 20th century.[24] Silvestre Vargas took over Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán from his father in 1958 and soon after hired a trained musician, Ruben Fuentes, as musical director. Fuentes along with Vargas were instrumental in the standardization of much of mariachi music, arranging traditional songs and writing new ones that would be performed by many of the legendary performers of the mid-20th century, such as Pedro Infante, Miguel Aceves Mejía, Lola Beltrán and José Alfredo Jiménez.[3] Mariachi Vargas still remains, tracing its history in terms of generations, starting in the 1890s, with these generations maintaining the group's authenticity as a mariachi while the music has evolved. The last Vargas associated with the group died in 1985. That the group still considers itself the original group comes from the notion of passing on the music by generations of musicians, as the original son jaliscense was learned.[25]

Regional Mexican radio stations in the United States include mariachi music in their programming. The most popular Latin music format in the US, the music style is well recognized throughout the country. The United States military has an official mariachi band in the New Mexico National Guard, called Mariachi Nuevo México; this pays homage to the state of New Mexico's Hispano and Mexican-American heritage.

The promotion of mariachi as representative of Mexico has led to the formation of mariachi groups in many countries such as Argentina, Aruba, Egypt, Chile, Cuba, Spain, Guatemala, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, with groups from these and other countries participating in Guadalajara's International Mariachi and Charreria Conference.[2][20][28]

The music has a strong following in the US, with top groups spending a lot of time on tour.[21]Mariachi Los Camperos received a Grammy nomination for best Mexican-American album.[21] Academic programs allow for instruction by famous mariachi groups and the opportunity to win awards.

The first mariachi groups in the United States were from California. Nati Cano was born in Jalisco in 1939 and moved to Los Angeles in 1959. He played in many mariachi groups backing singers but felt mariachi could stand alone. In 1969 he opened a restaurant called La Fonda in Los Angeles, which featured his group, Los Camperos, as part of a dinner show. The success of this enterprise, and of Los Camperos in general, have inspired many mariachi groups in the United States.[8] In the late 1980s, pop star Linda Ronstadt recorded ""Canciones de Mi Padre"" and ""Más Canciones"" with Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán and others, which helped promote its popularity among Mexican Americans and to non-Mexican Americans.[19]

Some U.S. public schools offer mariachi as part of classes.[31]  The first student mariachi group was begun in 1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles. This prompted the creation of other student organizations in other parts of California and then in Texas, where the first mariachi festival was held in 1979.[32] Since then, a strong synergy between academic programs and mariachi festivals has developed, which feature students and give mariachi classes and workshops.[33] This festival led to excitement in the Texas board of education, and soon Zeke Castro, a many award winning educator, was hired to teach mariachi.[34]

Once school programs were limited to border areas such as San Antonio and Tucson, but they have spread across the southwest and into other parts of the United States, especially since the 1990s. There are at least 500 schools offering classes along with local and state competitions.[31] In some US schools, mariachi ensembles have replaced school bands. Professional groups such as Mariachi Cobre, which regularly performs at Disney World, also spend time teaching in public schools.

In areas with large Mexican-American populations, mariachis are hired for events outside this ethnic group as well.[8] Outside of schools, the most important venue for the music in the United States is mariachi festivals, with the longest-running festivals in Tucson and Fresno.[35] The Tucson International Mariachi Conference began in 1982 and showcases over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools and college mariachi players.[36] The Las Vegas International Mariachi Festival, established in 1991, is televised on Telemundo and PBS and has headlined artists such as Pedro Fernández, Ana Gabriel, American-born mariachi singer Pepe Aguilar and more.[37]

The educational movement is controversial with some trained in the traditional manner, who are skeptical about these programs and their potential to change the tradition. The changes, especially standardization of publishing, are slowly impacting mariachi in Mexico. One difficulty of arranging mariachi pieces is that the son jaliscense that mariachi is based on alternates between 34 and 68 time. Much of the published mariachi music is meant for people already familiar with the music to serve as guides, not for novices. On the other hand, many schools have problems recruiting mariachi instructors as many of these do not have required teaching credentials. For this reason, schools often hire trained musicians from outside the mariachi tradition. Many traditional mariachis are concerned that standardization will lead to the genre becoming rule-bound and so restrict improvisation.[38]

Other innovations in the United States have been the incorporation of styles of artists such as Elvis Presley, Freddy Fender, Glenn Miller, Marty Robbins, and Johnny Cash, as well as the heavy-metal mariachi band Metalachi.[39] Another is the encouragement of female mariachis, including all-female mariachi groups such as Mariachi Mujer 2000, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles and Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea. Mariachi Mujer has performed with Mexican artists such as Vikki Carr, Pablo Montero, Gerardito Fernandez and Nydia Rojas. Mariachi Divas have won two Grammy Awards, have toured extensively in the United States and are the official mariachi of Disneyland Resort in Anaheim.[21] New York's first international all-female mariachi[40] is 2015 Latin Grammy[41] nominated Mariachi Flor de Toloache, who are featured in Dan Auerbach's The Arcs. An all-female mariachi in London, UK, Mariachi Las Adelitas UK, plays traditional Mexican mariachi music as well as some English-language covers in mariachi style.[42]

English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 2016 album Familia was inspired by a visit to Mexico. She posted a video in which she appears singing one of the songs from the album, ""Death of Love"", next to a group of mariachis in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco.

In the 1940s, the first all-female mariachi band created itself, directed by Carlota Noriega, with many more to follow in their path, primarily from the United States.[1] These women-led mariachis or musicians faced misogyny for taking on a style of music that was considered to be male-dominated space coming from the machismo ideology.[1] To embrace their own machismo form, these female groups would use their femininity and beauty to find success, singing songs about independence, life, heart, and the suffrage movement.[1][43] These female groups adopted the same traje de charro attire that the men but added long skirts and removed the sombreros.

In 1976, the first United States founded all-women mariachi group was Las Generalas. They made sure to keep their image clean by not drinking or playing late at night in order to make the American public respect mariachi.[44]

The most common dance technique in mariachi is zapateado, translated to ""tap dance"" is a kind of footwork adopted from the Spanish Flamenco dance. It is a percussive rhythmic dance that follows a plant of foot followed by a heel tap then another foot plant, and continues on this pattern.[45]

Ballet folklórico is a dance that is not directly linked to mariachi, but they are often performed on stage together. They both involve highly gendered performances, elaborate costumes, and invite audience participation.[46]"
"Ranchera","Ranchera (.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}pronounced [ranˈtʃeɾa]) or canción ranchera is a genre of traditional music of Mexico. It dates to before the years of the Mexican Revolution. Rancheras today are played in the vast majority of regional Mexican music styles. Drawing on rural traditional folk music, the ranchera developed as a symbol of a new national consciousness in reaction to the aristocratic tastes of the period.[citation needed]

The word ranchera was derived from the word rancho because the songs originated on the ranches and in the countryside of rural Mexico.

Traditional themes in rancheras are about love, heartbreak, patriotism or nature.

Rhythms can have a meter in 24 (in slow tempo:  ranchera lenta and faster tempo: ranchera marcha), 34 (ranchera vals), or 44 (bolero ranchero).[citation needed]

Songs are usually in a major key, and consist of an instrumental introduction, verse and refrain, instrumental section repeating the verse, and another verse and refrain, with a tag ending. Rancheras are also noted for the grito mexicano, a yell that is done at musical interludes within a song, either by the musicians and/or the listening audience.[citation needed]

The normal musical pattern of rancheras is a–b–a–b. Rancheras usually begin with an instrumental introduction (a). The first lyrical portion then begins (b), with instrumental adornments interrupting the lines in between. The instruments then repeat the theme again, and then the lyrics may either be repeated or begin a new set of words. One also finds the form a–b–a–b–c–b used, in which the intro (a) is played, followed by the verse (b).  This form is repeated, and then a refrain (c) is added, ending with the verse.[citation needed]

The most popular ranchera composers include Lucha Reyes, Cuco Sánchez, Antonio Aguilar, Juan Gabriel and José Alfredo Jiménez, who composed many of the best-known rancheras, with compositions totaling more than 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific songwriters in the history of western music.[citation needed]

Another closely related style of music is the corrido, which is often played by the same ensembles that regularly play rancheras. The corrido, however, is apt to be an epic story about heroes and villains, or the narrator's lifestyle.[citation needed]"
"Singer-songwriter","

A singer-songwriter is a musician who writes, composes, and performs their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. In the United States, the category is built on the folk-acoustic tradition with a guitar,[1] although this role has transmuted through different eras of popular music. Traditionally, these musicians would write and sing songs personal to them. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole musical accompaniment to an entire song. The piano is also an instrument of choice.

In the early 21st century, various digital production tools, examples including GarageBand and other software programs, began to be used by singer-songwriters to compose their music and otherwise work as an audio engineer enhancing media.

The label ""singer-songwriter"" (or ""song-writer/singer""[2]) is used by record labels and critics to define popular music artists who write and perform their own material, which is often self-accompanied – generally on acoustic guitar or piano.[3]
Such an artist performs the roles of composer, lyricist, vocalist, sometimes instrumentalist, and often self-manager.[4] According to AllMusic, singer-songwriters' lyrics are often personal but veiled by elaborate metaphors and vague imagery, and their creative concern is to place emphasis on the song rather than on their performance of it. Most records by such artists have a similarly straightforward and spare sound that places emphasis on the song itself.[5]

The term may also characterise songwriters in the rock, folk, country, and pop-music genres – including Henry Russell (1812–1900), Aristide Bruant (1851–1925), Hank Williams (1923–1953), and Buddy Holly (1936–1959). The phrase ""singer-songwriter"", recorded from 1949,[6] came into popular usage from the 1960s onwards[7] to describe songwriters who followed particular stylistic and thematic conventions, particularly lyrical introspection, confessional songwriting, mild musical arrangements, and an understated performing style.[8] According to writer Larry David Smith, because it merged the roles of composer, writer, and singer, the popularity of the singer-songwriter phenomenon reintroduced the Medieval troubadour tradition of ""songs with public personalities"" after the Tin Pan Alley era in American popular music.[9] Song topics of singer-songwriters from the American folk music revival include political protest, as in the case of Woody Guthrie (1912–1967) and Pete Seeger (1919–2014).[10] According to the Journal of Popular Music Studies, from the folk revival and onward into its permanence in pop music, the role of a singer-songwriter has involved several dimensions of creative identity:

The first aesthetic layer encourages songwriters to sing and perform their own works and to instill their own stylistic flavors into the song texts. The songwriters are not independent from the works once they are finished; rather, they enter into, activate, and authenticate the song texts through their vocal and musical performances. While the first layer does not always require the singer to be the songwriter, the second sociological layer not only fixates on the relationship between singer and songwriter (in this case, singer-songwriter is often hyphenated instead of using a slash between singer and songwriter), but also solicits more sociological agency aside from singing and songwriting, such as arranging, mixing, producing, collaborating, and media management. In other words, a singer-songwriter thus undergoes a thickening process involving two-layered voices, including performing stylistic persona, amassing other voices, and coordinating other sociological skills. This thickening process demonstrates the fluid, multiple, and heterogeneous voices underneath the singular authorial image, thus complicating the notion of authorship for singer-songwriters.[11]

The concept of a singer-songwriter can be traced to ancient bardic oral tradition, which has existed in various forms throughout the world. Poems would be performed as chant or song, sometimes accompanied by a harp or other similar instrument. After the invention of printing, songs would be written and performed by ballad sellers. Usually these would be versions of existing tunes and lyrics, which were constantly evolving. This developed into the singer-songwriting traditions of folk culture.

Traveling performers existed throughout Europe. Thus, the folklorist Anatole Le Braz gives a detailed account of one ballad singer, Yann Ar Minouz, who wrote and performed songs traveling through Brittany in the late nineteenth century and selling printed versions.[12]

In large towns it was possible to make a living performing in public venues, and with the invention of phonographic recording, early singer-songwriters like Théodore Botrel, George M. Cohan, and Hank Williams became celebrities; radio further added to their public recognition and appeal.

During the period from the 1940s through the 1960s, sparked by the American folk music revival, young performers inspired by traditional folk music and groups like the Almanac Singers and the Weavers began writing and performing their own original material and creating their own musical arrangements.[13]

In the early 21st century, the digital audio workstation GarageBand has been utilized by many aspiring singer-songwriters to compose and record music.[14] Singer-songwriters who have composed music professionally with GarageBand include Erykah Badu (for her 2008 album New Amerykah Part One)[15] and Bilal (for his 2010 album Airtight's Revenge).[16]

The term ""singer-songwriter"" in North America can be traced back to singers who developed works in the blues and folk music style. Early to mid-20th century American singer-songwriters include Lead Belly,[17]Jimmie Rodgers,[18]Blind Lemon Jefferson,[19]T-Bone Walker,[20]Blind Willie McTell,[21]Lightnin' Hopkins,[22]Son House,[23] and Robert Johnson.[24][25] In the 1940s and 1950s country singer-songwriters like Hank Williams became well known,[26] as well as Woody Guthrie, and Pete Seeger,[27] along with Ronnie Gilbert and Lee Hays and other members of the Weavers who performed their mostly topical works to an ever-growing wider audience.[28] These proto-singer-songwriters were less concerned than today's singer-songwriters with the unadulterated originality of their music and lyrics, and would lift parts from other songs and play covers without hesitation. The tradition of writing topical songs (songs regarding specific issues of the day, such as Lead Belly's ""Jim Crow Blues"" or Guthrie's ""Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)"") was established by this group of musicians. Singers like Seeger and Guthrie would attend rallies for labor unions, and so wrote many songs concerning the life of the working classes, and social protest; as did other folksingers like Josh White, Cisco Houston, Malvina Reynolds, Earl Robinson, Ewan MacColl, John Jacob Niles, and Doc Watson, while blues singers like Johnson and Hopkins wrote songs about their personal life experiences. This focus on social issues has greatly influenced the singer-songwriter genre. Additionally in the 1930s through the 1950s several jazz and blues singer-songwriters emerged like Hoagy Carmichael, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Harry Gibson, Peggy Lee, and Nina Simone, as well as in the rock n' roll genre from which emerged influential singer-songwriters Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, Ritchie Valens, and Paul Anka. In the country music field, singer-songwriters like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, Billy Edd Wheeler, and others emerged from the 1940s through the 1960s, often writing compelling songs about love relationships and other subjects.

The first popular recognition of the singer-songwriter in English-speaking North America and the United Kingdom occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s when a series of blues, folk and country-influenced musicians rose to prominence and popularity. These singer-songwriters included Bob Dylan, Neil Young, John Lennon, Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen, Albert Hammond, Gordon Lightfoot, and Joni Mitchell. Artists who had been primarily songwriters, notably Carole King, Townes Van Zandt, and Neil Diamond, also began releasing work as performers. In contrast to the storytelling approach of most prior country and folk music, these performers typically wrote songs from a highly personal (often first-person), introspective point of view. The adjectives ""confessional"" and ""sensitive"" were often used (sometimes derisively) to describe singer-songwriter style.

In the rock band era, members were not technically singer-songwriters as solo acts. However, many were singer-songwriters who created songs with other band members. Examples include Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, Elton John (with Bernie Taupin), Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Robbie Robertson, Ian Anderson, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Peter Frampton, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Country Joe McDonald, and Barry Melton. Many others like Eric Clapton found success as singer-songwriters in their later careers.

The scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival, pioneered by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger had grown to a major movement in the early 1960s, popularized by Joan Baez and her protégée, Bob Dylan, who had started reaching a mainstream audience with his hit, Blowin' in the Wind"" (1963) bringing ""protest songs"" to a wider audience.[29] There were hints of cross-pollination, but rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with different audiences.[30] An early attempt at fusing elements of folk and rock was highlighted in the Animals ""House of the Rising Sun"" (1964), a folk song, recorded with rock and roll instrumentation.[31]

By the mid-1960s Bob Dylan took the lead in merging folk and rock, and in July 1965, released ""Like a Rolling Stone"", with a revolutionary rock sound, steeped in tawdry urban imagery, followed by an electric performance later that month at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter. Often writing from an urban point of view, with poetry punctuated by rock rhythms and electric power, Dylan's fusing of folk and rock freed up emerging singer-songwriters to use elements of both traditions to tell their stories. In the mid- to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art/music scene. The release of The Velvet Underground & Nico in 1967, featuring singer-songwriter Lou Reed and German singer and collaborator Nico was described as the ""most prophetic rock album ever made"" by Rolling Stone in 2003.[32][33]

In the late '60s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvas for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in Newsweek, July 1969, ""The Girls: Letting Go: 'What is common to them – to Joni Mitchell and Lotti Golden, to Laura Nyro, Melanie, and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry.""[34] In The Guardian, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter—they sang about politics, love affairs, the urban landscape, drugs, disappointment, and the life and loneliness of the itinerant performer.[35]Lotti Golden, in her Atlantic debut album Motor-Cycle, chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late 1960s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the contemporary female singer-songwriter that has informed generations of women singer-songwriters into the 21st century,[35] with poet Warsan Shire as the muse for Beyoncé's 2016 album Lemonade.[36]

By the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the original wave of singer-songwriters had largely been absorbed into a more general pop or soft rock format, but some new artists in the singer-songwriter tradition (including Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, Chris Isaak, Victoria Williams, John Mellencamp, and Warren Zevon) continued to emerge, and in other cases rock and even punk rock artists such as Peter Case, Paul Collins, and Paul Westerberg transitioned to careers as solo singer-songwriters. Kate Bush remained distinctive throughout with her idiosyncratic style.

In the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with Suzanne Vega whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Nanci Griffith, k.d. lang, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Colvin, Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Joan Osborne, Indigo Girls, and Tori Amos, who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market. In the early 1990s, female artists also began to emerge in new styles, including Courtney Love and PJ Harvey. Later in the mid-1990s, the term was revived again with the success of Canada's Alanis Morissette and her breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill.

Also in the 1980s and 1990s, artists such as Bono, the Edge, Dave Matthews, Jeff Buckley, Richard Barone, Duncan Sheik, and Elliott Smith borrowed from the singer-songwriter tradition to create new acoustic-based rock styles. In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as Norah Jones, Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, David Bazan, South San Gabriel, Iron & Wine, David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, Meg Hutchinson, Darden Smith, Josh Rouse, Steve Millar, Jolie Holland, Patrick Duff, Richard Buckner, Jewel, Jack Savoretti, Richard Shindell, John Gorka, and Antje Duvekot. Some started to branch out in new genres such as Kurt Cobain, Noel Gallagher, T Bone Burnett, Eddie Vedder, and Pete Yorn. Others used drugs as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of Holy Sons took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an indie label.[37]

Recording on the professional-grade systems became affordable for individuals in the late 1990s. This created opportunities for people to independently record and sell their music. Such artists are known as ""indies"" because they release their records on independent, often self-owned record labels, or no label at all. Additionally the Internet has provided a means for indies to get their music heard by a wider audience.

French ""chanson"" comes from an old tradition, since the Middle Ages. It is driven by the rhythms of the French language. It can be distinguished from the rest of French ""pop"" music or soft rock format that began to spread in France during the 1960s until today, under the cultural influence of Anglo-American rock music and the rock band era.

The first modern French singer-songwriter was Charles Trenet, who began his solo career in 1938. He was the first to use jazz rhythms in chanson. He would remain an isolated act until the creative blooming of a new generation during the post-World War II era (mid-1940s and 1950s), where such artists as Léo Ferré, Georges Brassens, Félix Leclerc (from Quebec), Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel (from Belgium), Henri Salvador (from French Guiana), Charles Aznavour, and Barbara appeared, with contrasted and rich imagination. Most of them are recognized as great masters by younger generations of French artists, especially Ferré (for the richness of his lyrics, his melodic genius, his critical density on social issues and his body of work's profoundness) and Gainsbourg (for the bright and tasteful adaptation of pop or rock music with French language-driven rhythms).

During the 1960s and 1970s, prominent singer-songwriters included Claude Nougaro, Jean Ferrat, Boby Lapointe, Françoise Hardy, Frédérik Mey, Michel Polnareff, Nino Ferrer, Christophe, Bernard Lavilliers, Véronique Sanson and Jacques Higelin, amongst others.

Cantautori (Italian plural; the singular is cantautore) is the Italian expression corresponding to singer-songwriters in English. The word is a portmanteau of cantante (singer) and autore (writer).

The first internationally renowned cantautore was Domenico Modugno with his song ""Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)"", a huge best seller in 1958; other early cantautori, who began their careers in the late 50s, are Gino Paoli, Luigi Tenco, Umberto Bindi, Giorgio Gaber, and Enzo Jannacci.

Fabrizio De André, Lucio Battisti, and Francesco Guccini began their careers in the '60s, while Edoardo Bennato, Lucio Dalla, Francesco De Gregori, Franco Battiato, Rino Gaetano, Ivano Fossati, Antonello Venditti, Claudio Baglioni, Pino Daniele, Roberto Vecchioni, Angelo Branduardi, and Eugenio Finardi all appeared in the '70s.
Their songs are still popular today, often telling stories of marginalized (De André, Guccini, Dalla) and rebellious people (Finardi, De Gregori, Venditti), or having a political background (Venditti, Guccini).

Branduardi was greatly influenced by Medieval and Baroque musical styles, while his lyrics are usually inspired by ancient fables. Battiato started as a progressive rock and cultivated music artist in the 1970s, shifting to an original blend of pop, electronic, new wave, and world music in the 1980s.

Those canutautori linked to the city of Genoa (De André, Paoli, Bindi, Tenco, Baccini, etc.) are also referred as members of the Genoese School.

The Neapolitan cantautore Pino Daniele often fused genres as diverse as R&B, fusion, blues, pop, jazz, and tarantella to produce a sound uniquely his own, with lyrics variously in Italian, Neapolitan, or English. Similarly Paolo Conte was often tagged as a cantautore, but was more into the jazz tradition.

In the 1980s Vasco Rossi was renowned for his blend of blues-tinged rock music mixed with Italian melodies.
He was nicknamed the ""only Italian rockstar"" (l'unica rockstar italiana) by his fans.[38]

Mixing international sounds and Italian lyrics, in the 2000s Bugo became the ""fantautore"", a neologism coined for him.[39] Despite not having achieved great fame, he is considered the pioneer of the renewal of Italian songwriting, making a point to break from the politicised content of the 70s.[40]

In the last 25 years the tradition has mainly been continued by Samuele Bersani, Caparezza, and the so-called ""2nd Roman school of cantautori"" (including Max Gazzè, Niccolò Fabi, Daniele Silvestri, Simone Cristicchi).

The word has been borrowed into other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan cantautor, French chantauteur, Maltese kantawtur, Romanian cantautor, and Slovenian kantavtor.

Beginning in the 1960s and following the Italian cantautori style of the 1950s (like the one of Domenico Modugno), many Latin American countries developed singer-songwriter traditions that adopted elements from various popular styles. The first such tradition was the mid-1960s invention of nueva canción, which took hold in Andean countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia.

At around the same time, the Brazilian popular style bossa nova was evolving into a politically charged singer-songwriter tradition called Tropicalismo. Two performers, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso became two of the most famous people in all of Brazil through their work in Tropicalismo.

After World War II it was developed in Italy a very prolific singer-songwriter (in Italian cantautore) tradition, initially connected with the French school of the chansonniers, and lately developed very heterogeneously. Although the term cantautore normally implies consistent sociopolitical content in lyrics, noteworthy performers in a more inclusive singer-songwriter categorization are: Domenico Modugno, Luigi Tenco, Gino Paoli, Sergio Endrigo, Fabrizio De André, Francesco De Gregori, Antonello Venditti, Roberto Vecchioni, Ivano Fossati, Lucio Dalla, Francesco Guccini, and Franco Battiato.

In neighbouring Malta, the main singer-songwriters are Walter Micallef, Manwel Mifsud and Vince Fabri. They all perform in Maltese.

Spain and Portugal have also had singer-songwriter traditions, which are sometimes said to have drawn on Latin elements. Catalonia is known for the Nova Cançó tradition – exemplified by Joan Manuel Serrat and Lluís Llach; the Portuguese folk/protest singer and songwriter José Afonso helped lead a revival of Portuguese folk culture, including a modernized, more socially aware form of fado called nova canção. Following Portugal's Carnation Revolution of 1974, nova canção became more politicized and was known as canto livre. Another important Spain singer-songwriters are Joaquín Sabina, José Luis Perales, and Luis Eduardo Aute.

In the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s, socially and politically aware singer-songwriters like Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés emerged in Cuba, birthing a genre known as nueva trova. Trova as a genre has had broad influence across Latin America. In Mexico, for example, canción yucateca on the Yucatán Peninsula and trova serrana in the Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca, are both regional adaptations of trova. Today, Guatemalan Ricardo Arjona qualifies as Latin America's most commercially successful singer-songwriter. Although sociopolitical engagement is uneven in his oeuvre, some see Arjona's more engaged works as placing him in the tradition of the Italian cantautori.

In the mid-1970s, a singer-songwriter tradition called canto popular emerged in Uruguay.

With the influence of Tropicalismo, Traditional Samba and Bossa Nova, MPB (Música popular brasileira), or Brazilian Popular Music, became highly singer-songwriter based. For years solo artists would dominate Brazilian popular music with romantic cynicism alla Jobim or subliminal anti-government messages alla Chico Buarque.  After the end of the military dictatorship in Brazil, Brazilian music became less politically and socially conscious. The censored Raul Seixas or the humorous spiritualist Jorge Ben were slowly obscured by funk carioca, axé music, and Brazilian disco. In recent years, however, a new stock of socially conscious Brazilian singer-songwriters is beginning to break the almost strictly dance-music momentum that has reigned since the 1980s (see the 'Brazilian folk/folk-rock sub-article in Brazilian Music).

Since the 1960s, those singers who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment have been known as ""bards"". The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs are thought to be written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students' song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a Russian guitar, rarely if ever would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Though, bards using piano or accordion are also known. Those who became popular held modest concerts. The first nationwide-famous bards (starting their career in the 1950s) are traditionally referred to as the First Five: Mikhail Ancharov, Alexander Gorodnitsky, Novella Matveyeva, Bulat Okudzhava, and Yuri Vizbor. In the 1960s, they were joined by Vladimir Vysotsky, Victor Berkovsky, Yuliy Kim, and many others.

In the course of the 1970s, the shift to the classical 6-string guitar took place, and now, a Russian guitar is a rare bird with the bards. In the same period, the movement of KSP (Kluby Samodeyatelnoy Pesni – amateur song fan clubs) emerged, providing the bards with highly educated audience, and up to the end of the 1980s being their key promotion engine.  Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, partly given the political nature of many songs, partly due to their vague status in the strictly organised state-supported show business establishment of the USSR. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around as folk lore, from mouth to mouth, or via the copying of amateur recordings (sometimes referred as magnitizdat) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of political nature. Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in the fact that it is sung along with a simple guitar melody as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that this form of poetry focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry often takes the form of narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. On the other hand, in the USSR the chief bard supporter was the state Union of Composers, and the main bard hater was the state Union of Writers. A far more obvious difference was the commerce-free nature of the genre: songs were written to be sung and not to be sold. The similar genre dominated by singers-songwriters is known as sung poetry in other Post-Soviet countries.

Singer-songwriters are popular in Bulgaria under the name ""bards"", or ""poets with guitars"". Their tradition is a mixture of traditional folk motifs, city folklore from the early 20th century, and modern influences. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the Communist regime in the country started to tolerate the Bulgarian ""bards"", promoting the so-called ""political songs"", performed usually by one-man bands. A national festival tradition was established, under the title ""Alen Mak"" (Red Poppy), a symbol with strong Communist meaning in Bulgaria. At the same time, there were some prominent underground figures which were against the official Communist Party line, such as Angel ""Jendema"" Angelov, Yavor ""Yavkata"" Rilov, and Velizar ""Valdes"" Vankov.

After the collapse of Communism in 1989, the singer-songwriters' tradition was re-established. Currently, the Bulgarian ""bards"" enjoy several festivals (local and international) per year, namely the PoKi Festival (Poets with Guitars, Poetic Strings) in the town of Harmanli, the Bardfest in Lovech, the Sofia Evenings of Singer-Songwriters, and others. Major figures in the Bulgarian tradition are Dimitar Taralezhkov, Angel ""Jendema"" Angelov, Yavor ""Yavkata"" Rilov, Velizar ""Valdes"" Vankov, Dimitar Dobrev, Andro Stubel, Branimir ""Bunny"" Stoykov, Dorothea Tabakova, Mihail Belchev, Assen Maslarski, Grisha Trifonov, Plamen Stavrev, Vladimir Levkov, Margarita Drumeva, Maria Batchvarova, Plamen Sivov, and Krasimir Parvanov.[citation needed]

Despite the communist isolation, the tradition of the singer-songwriter in Romania flourished beginning with the end of the 1960s and it was put in the context of folk music, with its three main styles in Romania: ethno folk, American-style folk and lyrical (cult) folk. The framework for many of these initiatives came under the form of Cenaclul Flacăra, a series of mass cultural events with an inevitable ideological touch. Still, with the merit of supporting great opening initiatives: the appropriation of Western artists like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and others from the Woodstock generation, the public performance of gospel-like music, the opening to big international issues (pop culture, accountability of the leadership, tension surging during the Cold War-with surprisingly neutral positions, etc.).
Overall, the Romanian folk, in general, could be marked as an underground cultural movement, somewhere between non-aligned and protest music.[citation needed]

Rooted in the European Bänkelsang (""bench-singing"") and Moritat traditions while also taking immediate inspiration from the French chanson scene and the American folk music revival, the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a whole generation of German-language singer-songwriters called Liedermacher (""songmakers""), among them Hannes Wader, Franz Josef Degenhardt, Reinhard Mey, and Konstantin Wecker from West Germany, Wolf Biermann from East Germany as well as Ludwig Hirsch and Georg Danzer from Austria. With regards to content and style, the Liedermacher spectrum ranges from political balladeering to rather observational storytelling and love songs. The lyrics often deal with topics such as social injustice, militarism, consumerism, environmental issues or the repercussions of the German Nazi past, often expressing technoskepticism and anti-establishment views.[41]

In the mid-1960s, Sweden witnessed the renaissance of the ""trubadur"", the Swedish version of the singer-songwriter. Cornelis Vreeswijk and Fred Åkerström were particularly influential in their efforts to blend the heritage of the ""visa"" (a specific way to render simple stanzaic poems or songs, given distinction by artists such as Carl Michael Bellman and Evert Taube) with modern approaches to balladeering.[42]

Ede Staal (Warffum) (1941–1986) was a Dutch singer-songwriter from the Northern province of Groningen who sang mainly in the Groninger dialect of Dutch."
"Boom bap","

Boom bap is a subgenre and music production style that was prominent in East Coast hip hop during the golden age of hip hop from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.[1]

The term ""boom bap"" is an onomatopoeia that represents the sounds used for the bass (kick) drum and snare drum, respectively. The style is usually recognized by a main drum loop that uses a hard-hitting, acoustic bass drum sample on the downbeats, a snappy acoustic snare drum sample on the upbeats, and an ""in your face"" audio mix emphasizing the drum loop, and the kick-snare combination in particular.[2]

Prominent hip hop artists who incorporated ""boom bap"" in their music include Craig Mack, Run-DMC, Nas, LL Cool J, Gang Starr,[3]KRS-One, Mobb Deep, R.A. the Rugged Man, Boot Camp Clik, Griselda, Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, Common, Yasiin Bey, A Tribe Called Quest[4] and The Notorious B.I.G.[5]

Key producers include DJ Premier,[6][7]Easy Mo Bee, Large Professor, Pete Rock, Marley Marl, J Dilla, Statik Selektah, RZA, Q-Tip, The Alchemist, Daringer, Black Milk, Apollo Brown, 9th Wonder, Havoc, Da Beatminerz, Buckwild, Lord Finesse, Diamond D, and Showbiz.

The term boom bap originated in 1984 when it was used by T La Rock to describe the beat of the kick drum and the snare in the song ""It's Yours"".[8] T La Rock spoke in an off-script fashion, using the words ""boom bap"" to mimic the sound of the rhythm. This was the first recorded onomatopoeic expression of the beat. The term later became a universal name for the subgenre of hip hop as a whole. DJ Premier suggested that boom bap existed before the production of ""It's Yours"". He states the term was used by the wider hip-hop community as a term to describe all hip hop and the beat that is produced for it.[9] The subgenre became increasingly better known when KRS-One released an album under the title Return of the Boom Bap.[8] The success of the album popularised the term boom bap.[10]

The original songs produced within the subgenre used the actual sounds of kick drums and hard-hitting snare drums or samples from vinyl records.[11] The focus originally was on the simplicity of the beat whereas in later developments of the subgenre electronic samplers and beatmakers were used to generate the iconic beat.[12] Over time more percussion instruments were added to add to the complexity of the beat. Some examples of percussion instruments included were shakers, tambourines, bongos, and cowbells.[13] Musical programmers used digital sampling synthesizers to create more complex layers of sampled sounds and multi-layered drumbeats.[14] The original artist recognised by the hip hop industry as the first to experiment with these samples in boom bap was DJ Marley Marl.[8] The main purpose in using electronic instruments for the production of the music was to take the tedious repetition of the beat out of the creative process. This allowed artists to focus more on their lyrics and the meaning they were trying to convey.[9]

DJ Premier and Pete Rock gained notable fame as producers for their work within the boom bap industry.[9] These artists believe that the subgenre demonstrates ""strength and power"" through its harsh-sounding beat and roughness.[9] Boom bap was known for its popularity on the East Coast of the US and in particular its roots in New York. Where the West Coast hip hop scene displayed elements of smoothness, the East Coast and boom bap focused on hard edges and strong beats.[15] These artists in particular pioneered the subgenre by focusing on the rough elements of a stripped back beat and a strong focus on the lyrics.[16]

KRS-One when describing the beat common to the subgenre states ""The vibe of boom bap is to use the least amount of instruments to create the most rhythmic sound"".[9]

The typical boom bap beat will be a loop of quarter notes.[1] The first and the third being the kick drum and the second and fourth the snare.[17] The beat has become synonymous with the golden age of hip hop.[18] More modern hip-hop songs are influenced by boom bap and the underlying tone that is common to all songs in the subgenre.[19] The balance of the music tracks are brought together by the prominent kick and snare drum. The timbre is brought about by ""the emphasized low end of the kick drum and the presence of the hard-hitting snare drum"".[8] The arrangement of the beat is made of the isolated drum hits and other brief instrumental hits from percussion instruments.[11] The rhythmic qualities of the beat are made up of highly swung programming, which can be produced either by a deliberate delay in the analogue percussion hits or by a quantization algorithm programmed on an electronic sampler.[20] Other qualities that are present in boom bap rhythm are ""tight drum-instrumental syncopation"", ""re-arranged phrases or rhythms"", and ""percussive programming of instrumental phrases"".[8] When an artist or producer wished to add even more complexity or intense sounds to their track they could use a synthesiser. A common practise within boom bap was to use sub-synthesis.[14] This extra element would increase the amplitude of the bass and also intensify the sound of the kick drum.[14] This was a desirable feature of the hip hop style's unpolished and harsh style.

The beat is designed to ""exist solely as a basis for the artist to rap over"".[17] It intends to be ""visceral and rousing, it is hip hop at its brawniest"".[9]

The beat in some boom bap songs is interrupted by scratching. The process in which a disc jockey or hip hop producer will forcefully move the vinyl record back and forth underneath the needle.[21] This can also by achieved by using some CDs. The purpose of scratching was to disjoint the flow of the beat, to add some complexity or to develop a bridge in the song.[22] It was effective for rap battles and breaks in a rappers delivery. Scratching can also encompass the use of multiple vinyls, allowing the DJ to experiment with other works within the scope of their own song.[23] A scratch hook can be used as a method of sampling. For example DJ Premier's songs would often have a scratch hook of vocals. He commonly implemented this into his chorus.[24]

Sampling is used in boom bap music to enhance the beat beyond a simple drum pattern. Since the foundations of the beat are designed to be minimalistic, samples are used to add to the rhythm of the song and to create more diversity in the sounds.[25] Two of the most common electronic samplers used in this style are the Akai MPC and the SP1200.[1][25] Composers in this style use ‘short excerpts of the audio from a previous recording, recontextualized into a new composition’.[26] This can be heard in LL Cool J's ""Around the Way Girl"", a song and artist that utilizes boom bap features to create the hip hop beat.[27]

Swing quantization is used to create a more complex sound.[8] It allows the producer to keep precision on the 'on' beats and to offset the 'off' beats by a small margin. This influences the rhythmic flow of the piece. In this process, the producer is able to edit the timing of the musical performance.[28] The music sample can be stretched or condensed, and in some cases the beats are manipulated directly to achieve a perfect synchronisation. Swing quantization looks to provide a ratio of perfectly timed beats to off-timed beats.[29] The swing ratio can be adjusted on samplers such as the Akai MPC series.[26]

The general consensus at times was that electronic samplers brought a machine-like element to the style of music.[12] To maintain a human feel to the style, drum touch pads on the MPC and SP1200 were used so that artists could input their chosen samples at times they thought was best for the feel and the rhythm of the music.[30] The addition of touch pads allowed the artist to add improvements in ""not just timing, but also accents and velocity variations"".[8]

Boom bap music is often accompanied by rapping.[31] As boom bap instrumentals are characteristically sparse, the rapping plays an important role in boom bap songs, as it is the rapper and their lyrics who generally provide a song with its most distinctive sound.[8] The simplicity of the beat also provides the rapper with latitude to focus more prominently on presenting their opinions and narratives.[19]

The lyrical content in boom bap has been variously characterized as introspective and conversational,[32] raw and direct,[13] or macho and dominant.[17] Boom bap rappers generally avoid ""catchy or commercial"" sounds.[17] To that end, boom bap songs frequently eschew a chorus or sonic climax,[8] instead using the song as a means to tell a story or discuss a chosen topic with the audience.[1] Boom bap lyrics frequently focus on topics that reflect the African-American social experience on the East Coast of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, such as gang violence, social neglect, gentrification, drugs, wealth, sex, and life in segregated neighborhoods.[8][19]

In terms of technique, boom bap rapping follows major lyrical conventions within hip hop,[33] such as multi-syllabic rhyming, battle rapping and insults, sociological observations, puns and wordplay, and poetic devices such as extended metaphors or alliteration. The rapper's delivery and cadence are structured to best complement the beat.[17]

Boom bap music is sometimes conflated with hardcore hip hop, which exhibits a similar style of ""aggressive"" and ""street-style"" rapping;[10] however, boom bap as a subgenre is characterized more by the auditory experience of the beat rather than by the content of the lyrics.[14]

The subgenre of boom bap was popularised by KRS-One and his album Return of the Boom Bap. This album reached its peak on the United States weekly album chart the Billboard 200 at number 37 on 16 October 1993.[34] The album also peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums on the same day that the album peaked on the top 200.[35]

Boom bap began to gain popularity in the 1980s, but it had limited recognition on mainstream popular music charts. It existed more as an underground type of music.[36] The beat is often made synonymous with New York hip hop in the era. Welbeck states that ""the poly-rhythms of the 'boom-bap' rhythmic phrasings became a fixture of New York rap music in the late 1980s"".[37]

The boom bap movement after hitting its peak in the early 1990s made its way across the Atlantic and infiltrated some of the European music scenes.[38] Boom bap can often be found as a foundation for many modern day English rappers, which exhibit similar on-off beat. Boom bap also had a prominent influence on south-east Asia in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[39]

Boom bap is commonly recognised as delivering some of the founding elements of modern hip hop and rap music.[18] The simple style makes it easy to adapt and for artists to make their own impression upon the work.[18]

Due to much tighter copyright laws in the United States and around the world in recent years, the accessibility for sampling and regenerating sounds based on other's work has become increasingly difficult.[40][41] Some modern artists working for large record labels enjoy production budgets that permit them to pay to use others' work. However, this limits home-grown music production and thus leads hip hop enthusiasts to other more accessible forms of hip hop.[40] Artists gravitated away from sampling due to financial and career risks. One's creative ability can also be impacted when choosing to sample within a song. Hence, an overall drive for new content has emerged in the music industry.[42]

Phillip Mlynar states that in the modern world ""the notion of tagging something as boom bap has become more of a backhanded compliment. The phrase is frequently applied to East Coast hip hop to suggest that its architects are dated and trading on former glories"".[9]

In the London music scene boom bap is well known for its ""hard bass drum"" and ""snapping snare"", but it is commonly associated with ""old school"" tracks.[43]

Although not commercially popular, in the recent years boom bap has seen a small resurgence. In 2019, the Bristol-based rapper Wish Master (Liam Wish Kole) released an album called Boom Bap to the Future, and used the rhythmical quality as the foundation of the album's instrumental scoring, as well an allegory for retaining artistic self-control. However, critics were not entirely happy with the album, referring to its weak textual life, although commendable attempts at reviving the forgotten style.[44] Another regeneration of the boom bap style is being constructed through the London-based music collective called Sons of Boom Bap (S.O.B), whose mission is to reignite interest and lend social status to the old-school aesthetics of rapping, which include boom bap and other foundational stylistic attributes.[45]

However during the pandemic and with influence of platforms such as Verzuz,[46] multiple artist have released singles or full length projects with a boom bap aesthetic: J. Cole, Griselda, Redman, DJ Kay Slay, Lloyd Banks, the HRSMN, Rosenberg among others.[47][48][49][50][51] Current UK artists such as Triple Darkness who have been called the UK's Wu Tang Clan and Jam Baxter another British lyricist predominantly produce ""boom bap"" songs."
"East Coast hip hop","

East Coast hip hop is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in New York City during the 1970s.[3][4] Hip hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in The Bronx, New York City.[5]

In contrast to other styles, East Coast hip hop music prioritizes complex lyrics for attentive listening rather than beats for dancing.[5] The term ""East Coast hip hop"" more specifically denotes hip hop originating from the Northeastern United States. Southeastern states such as Georgia instead fall under the umbrella of Southern hip hop rather than East Coast hip hop, while New York  produces East Coast hip hop.[6][7][8]

In contrast to the more simplistic rhyme pattern and scheme utilized in older hip hop, hip hop in the late ‘80s developed a stronger emphasis on lyrical dexterity.[3] It also became characterized by multi-syllabic rhymes, complex wordplay, a continuous free-flowing delivery and intricate metaphors.[3] Although East Coast hip hop can vary in sound and style, ""aggressive"" beats and the combining of samples were common to the subgenre in the mid- to late 1980s.[5] The aggressive and hard-hitting beats of the form were emphasized by such acts as EPMD, Beastie Boys and Public Enemy, while artists such as Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. and Slick Rick were noted for their lyrical skill. Lyrical themes throughout the history of East Coast hip hop have ranged from lyrical consciousness by such artists as Public Enemy and A Tribe Called Quest to Mafioso rap themes by rappers such as Raekwon, MF Grimm and Kool G Rap.[3]

East Coast hip hop is occasionally referred to as New York rap due to its origins and development at block parties thrown in New York City during the 1970s.[3] According to AllMusic, ""At the dawn of the hip-hop era, all rap was East Coast rap.""[5] Leading up to hip hop, there were spoken-word artists such as the Last Poets who released their debut album in 1970, and Gil Scott-Heron, who gained a wide audience with his 1971 track ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"". These artists combined spoken word and music to create a kind of ""proto-rap"" vibe.[9] Following this, early artists of hip hop such as DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, Jam Master Jay and Run-DMC, pioneered East Coast hip hop during hip hop's earlier years in the 1970s and 1980s.[5]

As the genre developed, lyrical themes evolved through the work of East Coast artists such as the Native Tongues, a collective of hip hop artists associated with generally positive, Afrocentric themes, and assembled by Afrika Bambaataa. New York–based groups such as De La Soul, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest and the Jungle Brothers also earned recognition for their musical eclecticism.[5] This period from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s has been called the ""golden age"" of hip hop. Although East Coast hip hop was more popular throughout the late 1980s, N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton (released in the summer of 1988) presented the toughened sound of West Coast hip hop, which was accompanied by gritty, street-level subject matter.[5] Later in 1992, Dr. Dre's G-funk record The Chronic would introduce West Coast hip hop to the mainstream. Along with a combined ability to keep its primary function as party music, the West Coast form of hip hop became a dominant force during the early 1990s.[5] Although G-Funk was the most popular variety of hip hop during the early 1990s, the East Coast hip hop scene remained an integral part of the music industry. During this period, several New York City rappers rising from the local underground scene, began releasing noteworthy albums in the early and mid-1990s, such as Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. and others.[10]The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show was the launch pad for many East Coast rappers during this era.

Nas's 1994 debut album Illmatic has also been noted as one of the creative high points of the East Coast hip hop scene, and featured production from such renowned New York–based producers as Large Professor, Pete Rock and DJ Premier.[10] Meanwhile, The Wu-Tang Clan, Onyx, Black Moon, Smif-N-Wessun, Big L, Lost Boyz and Mobb Deep became pillars in New York's hardcore hip hop scene, achieving widespread critical acclaim for their landmark albums, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993),  Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous (1995), Enta da Stage (1993), Bacdafucup (1993), Dah Shinin' (1995), Legal Drug Money (1996) and The Infamous (1995).

The Notorious B.I.G. became the central figure in East Coast hip hop during most of the 1990s. Bad Boy Records comprised a team of producers known as the Hitmen Stevie J, Derrick ""D Dot"" Angelletie and Amen Ra directed by Sean Combs to move the focus on hip hop to New York with the Notorious B.I.G.'s Billboard topping hits.[11] His success on the music charts and rise to the mainstream drew more attention to New York at the time of West Coast hip hop's dominance.[11] According to AllMusic editor Steve Huey, the success of his 1994 debut album Ready to Die ""reinvented East Coast rap for the gangsta age"" and ""turned the Notorious B.I.G. into a hip-hop sensation — the first major star the East Coast had produced since the rise of Dr. Dre's West Coast G-funk"".[11] Many saw his dominating presence as a catalyzing factor in the East Coast/West Coast hip hop rivalry that polarized much of the hip hop community, stirring the issue enough to result in the Brooklyn rapper's 1997 death, as well as his West Coast counterpart, Tupac Shakur, months prior.[12] By the late 90s, East coast rap had returned to mainstream dominance.[13]

Biggie's commercial success helped pave the way for the success of other up-and-coming East Coast rappers such as Jay-Z, DMX, Busta Rhymes, 50 Cent, Ja Rule, the Lox, Fat Joe and Big Pun.[11][14]

A mainstream revitalization of East Coast rap occurred in the late 2000s and early 2010s, albeit without the same level of ubiquity as in the 1990s. Younger artists at this time used Internet resources such as social media, blogging, and music streaming to build a following among fans,[15][16] blurring the lines between the underground and the mainstream. Rappers who emerged during this  ""blog era"" include J. Cole (himself a transplant from North Carolina), Joey Bada$$, Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, Meek Mill, Vast Aire, Wale, Logic and Azealia Banks.

Various factors have led to a decline in unique regional scenes across many musical genres, including East Coast rap. In addition, rivalries between different cities and regions have declined significantly and artists across different regions and genres are much more willing to collaborate than in the past. Despite this, the distinctive East Coast sound is still notable in today's music, often mixed with modern trap sounds. Lil Uzi Vert from Philadelphia began their career representing the East Coast style, but moved to Atlanta to join others such as Lil Yachty and Playboi Carti, all of whom gained popularity by using online social media.[17]

In addition, New York City's drill movement, heavily influenced by UK drill (and often using the same London producers), has injected new energy into the New York hip hop scene, attracting critical acclaim, media controversy and a significant following, despite departing from standard hip hop song structures.[18] The movement started in Brooklyn, led by artists such as the late Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, and 22Gz.[18]

in addition TikTok's influence on East Coast rap is profound, shaping both the music and its reception. The platform's viral challenges and trends propel songs to mainstream attention, enabling emerging artists to gain exposure rapidly. East Coast rappers like Coi Leray, Sleepy Hallow, and Xaviersobased utilize TikTok to share snippets, teasers, and dance challenges, engaging directly with fans and cultivating a dedicated following.

East Coast hip hop was the dominant form of rap music during the Golden Era of hip hop.[3] Many knowledgeable hip hop fans and critics are particularly favorable towards East Coast hip hop of the early-mid 1990s, viewing it as a time of creative growth and influential recordings, and describing it as ""The East Coast Renaissance"". Music writer May Blaize of MVRemix Urban comments on the nostalgia felt among hip hop fans for records released during this time:

It was claimed as the East Coast Renaissance. Wu-Tang brought the ruckus with 36 Chambers. The world was ours when Nas released Illmatic. Big L, (The MVP) came out with Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous. Temperatures rose in clubs when Mobb Deep came out with The Infamous and Brooklyn's finest Jay-Z released Reasonable Doubt. . . And who can forget the powerful uplifting anthem that would brand New York's concrete ""Bucktown"" (Smif-n-Wessun's hit single)? . . .Ahh, it was a beautiful time in hip-hop history that many of us wish we could return to.[19]

David Drake of Stylus Magazine writes of hip hop during 1994 and its contributions, stating: ""The beats were hot, the rhymes were hot – it really was an amazing time for hip-hop and music in general. This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work – Digable Planets, Gang Starr, Pete Rock, Jeru, O.C., Organized Konfusion – I mean, this was a year of serious music.""[10]"
"Hardcore hip hop","

Hardcore hip hop (also hardcore rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that developed through the East Coast hip hop scene in the 1980s. Pioneered by such artists as Run-DMC, Schoolly D, Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy, it is generally characterized by anger, aggression and confrontation.

Music experts have credited Run-DMC as the first hardcore hip hop group.[1] Other early artists to adopt an aggressive style were Schoolly D in Philadelphia and Too $hort in Oakland. Before a formula for gangsta rap had developed, artists such as Boogie Down Productions and Ice-T wrote lyrics based on detailed observations of ""street life"", while the confrontational and aggressive lyrics and chaotic, rough production style of Public Enemy's records set new standards for hardcore hip hop and hip hop production.[2] Though initially a largely East Coast phenomenon, by the late 1980s, hardcore rap increasingly became largely synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap, with artists like N.W.A infusing ""gangsta"" themed stories of gritty gang life.

In the early 1990s, hardcore hip hop again became associated with the East Coast as Wu-Tang Clan emerged with minimalistic beats and piano-driven sampling, which became widely popular among other hardcore hip hop artists of the time.[2] In the early, late 90s and early 2000s, other New York based artists like Onyx, DMX[3][4] and M.O.P.[5] incorporated yelling in their lyrics. In the 2010s, punk rap combined elements of hardcore hip hop and hardcore punk, with artists like Denzel Curry at the forefront.[6][7]

Gangsta rap has often been associated with the hardcore hip hop style, and gangsta rap is generally considered a subgenre or offshoot of hardcore hip hop. However, not all hardcore hip hop revolves around ""gangsta"" lyrical themes, despite the considerable overlap between the two genres, especially within hardcore rappers of the 1990s.[2] Hardcore hip hop is characterised by aggression and confrontation and generally describes violence or anger. Russell Potter wrote that while hardcore rap has been associated with a ""monolithic 'gangsta' outlook"" by the popular press, hardcore rappers have ""laid claim to a wide variety of ground"".[8]"
"Hyphy","

The term hyphy (/ˈhaɪfiː/ HY-fee) is an Oakland, California slang meaning ""hyperactive"".[1] More specifically, it is an adjective describing the hip hop music[1][2] and the culture associated with the Oakland area.[3] The term was first coined by Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak.[1][3]

The hyphy culture emerged in the late 1990s in Oakland before rising to prominence throughout the wider Bay Area in the early 2000s. It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and has been compared to crunk music. San Jose producer Traxamillion is largely considered the first producer to create hyphy style music, having produced songs such as Keak Da Sneak's ""Super Hyphy"", which established the term hyphy. An individual is said to ""get hyphy"" when they dance in an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overloud with other people. The phrase ""to get hyphy"" is similar to the southern phrase ""to get crunk"". Those who consider themselves part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior.[2]

Although the Hyphy Movement briefly saw light in mainstream America, it has been an established subculture in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Throughout the Bay Area (particularly in East Oakland), there are events regularly hosted called ""sideshows"", where people perform or watch illegal automobile performances. These performances include activities such as donuts, ghost-riding (an action that has proven fatal on multiple occasions) [4] and street racing, while others dance and ""go dumb"" around them. The Hyphy Movement's resurgence in early 2006 was cited by prominent Bay Area rapper E-40 as a new opportunity for the Bay Area's unique sound to reach a nationwide audience.[5] Hyphy music was not only popular in The Bay Area, but in Portland, Oregon and Seattle as well.

For many Bay Area natives, rapper Mac Dre is cited as the individual who spearheaded the general public's interest in Hyphy music after his sudden death in 2004. Mac Dre's Treal TV DVD special represented  everything Hyphy, from what goes on at the sideshows to street slang, and common dances like ""going dumb"" and the ""thizzle dance"" became popular moves created by Mac Dre.[5] Many artists, such as Drake and DJ Mustard, pay homage to Mac Dre due to his huge influence in their musical career.[6] With the start of Mac Dre's label, Thizz Entertainment, he was able to shine a light on local talent such as E-40 and Andre Nickatina, prominent members of the Bay Area rap scene.[7]

Jerkin' or Jerk is a street dance and accompanying musical style derived from hyphy originating from and popularized by the Inland Empire-based groups New Boyz and Audio Push, and has origins in the Inland Empire and Los Angeles. Since 2009, jerkin' gained fans along the West Coast and, as of 2009, was gaining popularity in the East Coast.

In the early to mid-2010s, the genre of hyphy music saw a resurgence in the mainstream as a part of being a stylistic influence to an up tempo and club oriented type of mainstream hip hop known as ""ratchet music,""[8] which was popularized by various Los Angeles producers, including DJ Mustard.[9] The production style of DJ Mustard is adapted from hyphy music and played a role in bringing West Coast hip hop back to national attention.[10][11][12] DJ Mustard has been attached in producing for popular artists' singles, which include: Tyga's, ""Rack City,"" 2 Chainz's ""I'm Different,"" Young Jeezy's ""R.I.P.,"" B.o.B's ""HeadBand,"" YG's ""My Nigga"" and ""Who Do You Love?"" (as well as the majority of his 2014 debut album My Krazy Life), Ty Dolla Sign's ""Paranoid,"" Kid Ink's ""Show Me,"" Trey Songz's ""Na Na,"" Omarion's ""Post to Be,"" and Big Sean's ""I Don't Fuck With You,"" among others.

Among the local, more peripheral acts that achieved success outside of the Bay Area include Lil B, a member of the Berkeley rap group The Pack that has built a strong cult following on the Internet; the Richmond-based hip hop collective HBK Gang with individual members Iamsu!, Kehlani, Sage the Gemini, and P-Lo making their marks in the mainstream; Oakland-born pop rapper G-Eazy, who has gained two Billboard Top-10 hits with ""Me, Myself & I"" and ""No Limit"" (the latter featuring ASAP Rocky and Cardi B); and the Vallejo-based quartet SOB x RBE, who found mainstream attention after being featured on the track ""Paramedic!"" in the Kendrick Lamar-curated soundtrack album for the 2018 superhero film Black Panther.

In November 2011,[13] Canadian hip hop artist Drake released the song ""The Motto,"" featuring Young Money labelmate Lil Wayne, as the fourth single for his sophomore album Take Care. The song's instrumental (produced by T-Minus) takes major influence from hyphy music, and was a commercial success in the US—having sold 3,113,000 copies in the US as of April 2013—due to the meteoric popularity of the catchphrase YOLO during that time.[14] It peaked atop both the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and US Rap Songs charts, and was ranked 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart. ""The Motto"" was also nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Grammy Awards.[15] A music video was released on February 10, 2012, and features cameos from Bay Area rappers E-40 and Mistah F.A.B. as well as including an introduction from the mother of Mac Dre, Wanda Salvatto. Salvatto has also said, in a 2016 interview with Complex Media, that Drake told her how Mac Dre influenced him when he was 15 years old, and how important that was to him.[9]

In March 2022 a music documentary about the Hyphy movement We Were Hyphy, by Bay Area documentary filmmaker, Laurence Madrigal, was released. It featured many of the well-known artists of the Hyphy movement, including Keak da Sneak, Mistah F.A.B and Rick Rock. It also featured contemporaneous musicians, including G-Eazy, Kamaiyah and P-Lo.[16]

DJ Mustard's popularity around the same time began another movement that stemmed from the Bay Area, known as R&Bass. Coined by producer J Maine, this movement has gained widespread popularity, specifically on the Internet.[17][18] R&Bass blends hyphy music with contemporary R&B, thus garnering crossover appeal. Artists like Jonn Hart, Rayven Justice, and producers like Christopher Dotson embrace the R&Bass style. As well, through this movement, there have been numerous collaborations with various hyphy artists, including E-40.[19]

As a result of the recognizably and commonality between many of DJ Mustard's chart-topping singles, a number of artists who employ production similar to his have been criticized for unoriginality and sometimes plagiarism, with some of the biggest offenders of this style rip-off including the 2014 chart-topping Iggy Azalea single, ""Fancy"" and ""Classic Man,"" the 2015 debut single by rapper Jidenna which samples ""Fancy"".[20] However, the popularity of Mustard's style started to gain influence outside of hip hop. In 2012, electronic dance music (EDM), which incorporated elements of southern trap music, began gaining popularity and brought wider attention to the derivative forms of trap, including hyphy,[21] as well as Jamaican Dancehall music. This so-called ""EDM Trap"" genre saw the use of techno, dub, and house sounds combined with the Roland TR-808 drum samples and vocal samples typical of trap.

In December 2013, French producer DJ Snake and American rapper Lil Jon released the single ""Turn Down for What"", which became both a commercial hit charting in several countries and a viral hit throughout 2014. The composition of the song borrows elements from crunk and hyphy songs, and Rolling Stone voted ""Turn Down For What"" as the second best song of 2014, saying that, ""The year's nutsiest party jam was also the perfect protest banger for a generation fed up with everything. DJ Snake brings the synapse-rattling EDM and Southern trap music; Lil Jon brings the dragon-fire holler for a hilarious, glorious, glowstick-punk fuck you.""[22]

The success of ""Turn Down for What"" set the standard for Trap EDM and even Pop music in the mid-2010s, which kept the influence and legacy of hyphy music alive. Among those songs include the DJ Snake and Major Lazer collaboration ""Lean On,"" the Skrillex-produced Justin Bieber single ""Sorry,"" and the chart-topping 2016 song ""Closer"" by American DJ duo The Chainsmokers."
"Latin hip hop","Latin hip hop (also known as Latin rap) is hip hop music that is recorded by artists in the United States of Hispanic and Latino descent, along with Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean, North America, Central America, South America, and Spain.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, most Latin rap came from New York and the West Coast of the United States. Due to the heaviest Puerto Rican migration to New York City in the '50s, during the '70s, the birth of hip hop involved Latinos from the Caribbean islands. DJ Kool Herc was from Jamaica. Puerto Rico loved Hip Hop from America, and among the early rappers from the island were Ruben DJ, DJ Negro, and Vico-C. [1]

Mellow Man Ace, from Cuba, was the first Latino artist to have a major bilingual single, the 1989 track ""Mentirosa"". This song went platinum, leading Mellow Man Ace to be described as the ""Godfather of Latin rap"" and inducted into the Hip Hop Hall of Fame inductee. In 1990, fellow West Coast artist Kid Frost further brought Latinos to the rap forefront with his hit song ""La Raza (song).""[2] In 1991, Kid Frost, Mellow Man, A.L.T. and several other Latin rappers formed the rap super group Latin Alliance and released a self-titled album which featured the hit ""Lowrider (On the Boulevard)"". The remake of the song Tequila was a A.L.T. hit later that year. Cypress Hill, of which Mellow Man Ace was a member before going solo, would become the first Latino rap group to reach platinum status in 1991. The group was also the first major hip-hop music group to include Spanish and Latin slang in their lyrics. Cypress Hill gained hit ""Insane in the Brain""(1993) and Platinum record.[3] Ecuadorian-born American rapper Gerardo received heavy rotation on video and radio for his single Rico Suave. While commercially watered-down, his album enjoyed a status of being one of the first mainstream Spanglish CDs on the market. Johnny J was a multi-platinum songwriter, music producer, and rapper who was perhaps best known for his production on Tupac Shakur's albums All Eyez on Me and Me Against the World.[4] He also produced the 1990 single Knockin' Boots for his classmate Candyman's album Ain't No Shame in My Game, which eventually went platinum thanks to the single.[5]N2Deep, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Proper Dos, and Slow Pain were popular in latin rap scene.

In the mid-1990s, the success of LA's Cypress Hill led to additional Latin hip-hop artists finding label support. Delinquent Habits were a horn-sampling trio that found MTV support for their breakout bilingual single ""Tres Delinquentes"" in 1996. By the early 2000's, two Mexico-born, United States-raised Latin hip hop acts found success on major labels. LA's Akwid fused banda with hip-hop on hits like ""No Hay Manera"" while Milwaukee's Kinto Sol told tales of Mexican immigrant life over more minimalist beats. Mr.Criminal, Mr.Capone-E, Mr.Knightowl, Ms.Krazie, Charlie Row Campo and Mr.Sancho released latin and Chicano rap CDs.[6]

DJ Charlie Chase fused hip-hop with salsa and other music genres. Chase was the DJ for the New York hip-hop group the Cold Crush Brothers, from 1978 and through the '80s.[7] East Coast Latin artists such as the Beatnuts emerged in the early 1990s, with New Jersey native Chino XL earning recognition for his lyricism and equal controversy for his subject matter. In 1992, Mesanjarz of Funk, led by the Spanish/English flow of Mr. Pearl, became the first Spanish rap group signed to a major label (Atlantic Records).  In 1994, Platinum Producer and DJ Frankie Cutlass used his own label, Hoody Records, to produce his single “Puerto Rico” which became a classic. In the late 1990s, Puerto Rican rapper Big Punisher became the first Latino solo artist to reach platinum sales for an LP with his debut album Capital Punishment, which included hit song ""Still Not a Player"". The genre even spawned a bicultural novelty, the Brooklyn-based crew Hip Hop Hoodíos, who fused their dual Jewish and Latino cultures on songs like ""Havana Nagila"" and ""Raza Hoodía.""

Latin rap (as well as its subgenre of Chicano rap) has thrived along the West Coast, Southwest and Midwestern states with little promotion due to the large Latino populations of those regions. Jonny Z is considered to be a pioneer of Latin hip-hop, due to him being one of the first Latinos combining Spanglish lyrics with freestyle, salsa, mambo, and regional Mexican banda. He scored four Billboard Hot Dance singles between 1993 and 1997, including one of the greatest Miami bass songs of all time, ""Shake Shake (Shake That Culo)"". Besides bass music, he also recorded the Chicano anthem ""Orale"". The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States Volume 2, Page 301 states: ""A new style of Latina and Latino hip-hop was created in Miami and Texas by the bass rappers DJ Laz and Jonny Z, who mixed Latin styles with bass music"".[8]

Latin rap in Puerto Rico has had a substantial impact on the genres (rap, and Latin rap) and relate a certain message to their respective audiences. Puerto Rican rap emerged as a form of cultural and social protest within the Puerto Rican context.[9] This is similar to the way American and Jamaican youth used rap and reggae/dancehall as a means to communicate their feelings on social, cultural, and political issues. In essence, Puerto Rican rap became the voice of the Puerto Rican youth in which they use dancehall and rap music as methods of expression for the Jamaican and working-class American youth counterparts as they made it in France too since 2003 ""1492 Army"".[9]

In the late 1990s, hip-hop took hold in Mexico, especially with the platinum success of Mexican rap pioneers Control Machete. The genre also found prominence with Latin alternative artists who fused hip-hop rhymes with live instrumentation, including rap-rockers Molotov and cumbia-rockers El Gran Silencio.

There are many hip-hop scenes in Latin America, including a growing rap movement in Buenos Aires and Montevideo.[10]

Hip hop in Uruguay has had a significant presence since the late 1990s, with groups such as Sudacas en Guerra, Oeste Pro Funk, Plátano Macho and El Peyote Asesino. Starting in 2003, the genre began to develop progressively in the country, especially after latejapride* joined Bizarro Records. Since then, numerous groups and artists have emerged on the Uruguayan hip hop scene, including Beat Urbano, Arrajatabla Flow Club & The Warriors, Magia Negra Squad, Primate and Cubaguayo, among others. [11]

Conclusion
Each of these countries' hip-hop scenes reflects their unique cultural contexts and social issues. While facing distinct challenges, these communities continue to use hip-hop as a powerful tool for expression and social commentary.
[12] Uruguayan Hip-Hop Development: New Rappers such as 44 Kid ,Zanto, Davus, Mesita, and Rodridi recorded rap singles or albums.

A music scene, similar to the early underground gangsta rap scene, has emerged in northeastern Mexico (Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila), where the musical phenomenon of hip-hop is being co-opted by the influence of organized crime and the drug war in the region.

Some of the main exponents of the genre are Cano y Blunt, DemenT and Big Los.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

In the mid-1980s, freestyle music was initially called ""Latin hip hop"". This dance music genre, not to be confused with improvised freestyle rapping, was dominated, at the time, by electro funk beats and electronic Latin melodic and percussion elements, over which Latino vocalists sang melodramatic pop vocals, usually in English even though it was started by Nuyorican natives and African-Americans primarily.[20][21] Freestyle has been primarily popular among Latinos in the New York City, Miami, Chicago and California club scenes, but achieved national mainstream pop success with hits by Lisa Lisa, the Cover Girls, George Lamond, Stevie B, TKA and Exposé, among others.[20][21]

In 2015, a new movement of trap music referred to as ""Latin trap"" began to emerge.[22] Also known as Spanish-language trap, Latin trap similar to mainstream trap which details ""'la calle,' or the streets — hustling, sex, and drugs"".[23] Prominent artists of Latin trap include Messiah, Fuego, Anuel AA and Bad Bunny.[24] In July 2017, The Fader wrote ""Rappers and reggaetoneros from Puerto Rico to Colombia have taken elements of trap — the lurching bass lines, jittering 808s and the eyes-half-closed vibe — and infused them into banger after banger.""[24] In an August 2017 article for Billboard's series, ""A Brief History Of,"" they enlisted some of the key artists of Latin trap—including Ozuna, De La Ghetto, Bad Bunny, Farruko and Messiah—to narrate a brief history on the genre.[22][25] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone noted ""[Jorge] Fonseca featured Puerto Rican artists like Anuel AA, Bryant Myers and Noriel on the compilation Trap Capos: Season 1, which became the first ""Latin trap"" LP to reach Number One on Billboard's Latin Rhythm Albums chart.""[26] A remixed version of Cardi B's hit single ""Bodak Yellow"" (which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart), dubbed the ""Latin Trap Remix"", was officially released on August 18, 2017 and features Cardi B rapping in the Spanish language with Dominican hip hop recording artist Messiah contributing a guest verse.[27][28][29] In November 2017, Rolling Stone wrote that ""a surging Latin trap sound is responding to more recent developments in American rap, embracing the slow-rolling rhythms and gooey vocal delivery popularized by Southern hip-hop.""[26]
In addition, Venezuelan hiphop has emerged in an explosive way with very talented artists such as Neutro shorty and big soto"
"Chicano rap","Chicano rap is a subgenre of hip hop that embodies aspects of the Mexican American or Chicano culture.

The first recognized Chicano rap album was the 1990 debut album Hispanic Causing Panic by Kid Frost;[1] the album's lead single, ""La Raza"", which combined East L.A. and Tex-Mex elements, was a hit song and became an ""East L.A. anthem.[2] His success brought attention to Chicano rappers on the West Coast.[3]

In 1990, A.L.T. released the album Another Latin Timebomb, featuring his hit remake of the song ""Tequila"". In 1990, the Chicano hip hop group A Lighter Shade of Brown released their album Brown & Proud,[4] which included hits ""On a Sunday Afternoon"" (a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100) and ""Latin Active"". Rap group Cypress Hill (One Cuban, One Puerto Rican), would sometimes use popular Chicano slang and culture in their music and videos.  The lead rapper, B-Real, was of Mexican descent. Cypress Hill has also collaborated with another Chicano group, Psycho Realm. Chicano rap derives from American rap which bases its music on drum beats, jazz music, and bass amongst others. Early influences for Chicano rap include ""oldies"", funk music and later incorporated conjunto and banda.[5] Stemming from a long culture of mestizaje, Chicano rap uses samples from a wide range of music. Chicano can differentiate itself by sometimes having acoustic guitars playing Spanish melodies in the background or intros with Mexican regional music beats. Chicano Rap can be distinguished by sometimes having both English and Spanish verses. Some of the common themes within Chicano rap include but are not limited to: Love, experiences of being Mexican in the United States of America, Political problems, inequality, but also drug usage and money.[1] Chicano rap often include narratives that include gang violence and life in the varrio, by using lyrics in 'Spanglish', Chicano rap embraces the reality of being Mexican-American.[6]

During the late 1980s and 90s Chicano rap was brought by artist who shared their personal experiences through their lyrics.[6]

In the mid-1990s, Eazy-E formed the group Brownside.  Consisting of members Wicked, Klever, and Trouble, Brownside was essentially the Chicano equivalent of N.W.A.[7]  Drawing their experiences in society into their music, Brownside illustrated the harsh realities of life and the Chicano experience.

During the 1990s, some Chicano rappers such as Sinful of the Mexicanz began using influences from Mexican music in their beats and delivery, although this subgenre of music is sometimes referred to today as ""urban regional"" and not always representative of Chicano rap.[8][9] The hip hop group Akwid also combines traditional Mexican regional music with hip hop vocals.

Starting from the release of his 1995 album, Smile Now, Die Later, Kid Frost began to include the issues of immigration and drug trafficking related to the US-Mexico border by incorporating the sound of narcocorridos into his raps, further establishing the connection between Mexican folk music and Chicano rap.[6]

Thump Records, Urban Kings Music and Low Profile Records introduced new Chicano rap artists. New artists include Ms Krazie,[10]Knight Owl,[11] Chino Grande,[12] and Mr. Sancho.[13] Charlie Row Campo released ""Stop Studio Gangstas"" album in 2007.[14] One of the most widely recognized Chicano rappers today is Lil Rob of San Diego, his album ""Natural High/High Till I Die"" sold 90,000 copies[15] and his single ""Summer Nights"" was considered a major crossover and received heavy rotation on radio stations and video programs not directly related to Chicano rap music.[16] This widely successful artist has recently reappeared in the limelight, with the song Summer Nights being used in TikTok trends, and even being sampled in Destiny Roger's 2022 hit by the same name.[17]

Another widely known Chicano rapper is Serio of Los Angeles, with his 2012 single ""Don't Hate Me Because I'm Mexican"" featuring Proper Dos and Conejo, a controversial song that called for immigration reform.[18][19][20]

A Chicano rap scene has also begun to emerge in Texas. Prominent Texan artists in the genre include South Park Mexican (SPM) and Dope House Records.[21] SPM's sound includes influences similarly seen in the scene of West Coast Chicano rap: Latin beats, gangsta narratives, and G-Funk, however SPM differentiates itself by including sounds and vocabulary unique to the Houston hip hop scene with the newly added influence of corporate rap.[1]

Many Chicano rappers have been heavily influenced by Mexican history, including many themes relevant to the Mexican and Chicano people living in the United States and Mexico.[22] Chicano rap is mainly enjoyed by hip hop listeners in the United States, but also has established a cult fan base in Australia and the Philippines. Its main audience, however, consists of Hispanics/Latinos living on the West Coast, the Southwest, and the Midwest. Chicano culture has even reached Japan,[23] where a small minority dresses in flannels and baggy pants, drives lowriders, and listens to Chicano rap. The Chicano rap style and culture's introduction in Japan can be attributed to Mexican-American soldiers stationed in Japan.[24] Although there have been some concerns over cultural appropriation between these outcroppings of Chicano-style culture in other countries, comments under YouTube videos and reviews of music made by non-Chicanos has generally been positive. Many Chicanos choose to look at this outcropping as a sort of appreciation of their culture, rather than appropriation. Chicano rap's ability to reach large audiences without mainstream airplay or media promotion is due largely in part to nationwide lowrider car tours and their accompanying concerts headlined by Chicano rappers.[25] This environment allows Chicano rap artists to earn significant incomes through independent label releases while promoting directly to a target audience.[26]"
"Political hip hop","

Political hip hop (also known as political rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that was developed in the 1980s as a way of turning hip hop into a form of political activism. Political hip hop generally uses the medium of hip hop music to comment on sociopolitical issues and send political messages to inspire action, create social change, or to convince the listener of a particular worldview. It was inspired partially by politically-focused 1970s artists such as The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron, as well as the Black Power movement and revolutionary politics of the 1960s and 1970s. Various hip hop artists emerged in the late 1980s espousing political messages and providing social and political commentary with KRS-One and his group Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy in particular establishing themselves as some of the first predominantly political hip hop groups with albums in 1988. Soon to follow in 1989 and following years were other Political rappers, or known as ""Conscious rap"" including such groups as X-Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers, Paris (rapper), Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and others  [1] The genre has helped to create a new form of social expression for subordinate groups to speak about their exclusions, injustices, and lack of power.[2][3]

There is no all-encompassing political hip hop ideology, rather, there are multiple perspectives that range anywhere from anarchism to Marxism to the values of the Five-Percent Nation. Hip hop and politics have long been intertwined, with many hip hop artists using their music as a means to speak out about political and social issues and express their views on current events. Over the years, there have been a number of hip hop songs that have addressed political issues such as police brutality, racism, and poverty, among others. Some well-known examples of political hip hop songs include:

[4][5]

Many hip hop artists have also been involved in political activism outside of their music. For example, Chuck D of Public Enemy has been involved in a number of political campaigns and organizations, and has used his music and public platform to speak out about issues such as police brutality and racism. Similarly, rapper and activist Common has been involved in a number of social justice causes, and has used his music to address issues such as police violence and racial inequality.[4]

Conscious hip hop (also known as socially conscious hip hop or conscious rap) is a subgenre of hip hop that challenges the dominant cultural, social, political, sociopolitical, philosophical, and economic consensus,[6] and/or comments on or focuses on social issues and conflicts. Conscious hip hop is not necessarily overtly political, but the terms ""conscious hip hop"" and ""political hip hop"" are frequently used interchangeably, and conscious hip hop may often be implicitly political. Conscious hip hop began to gain traction in the 1980s, along with hip hop in general. The term ""nation-conscious rap"" has been used to more specifically describe conscious hip hop music with certain strong political messages and themes, especially Black empowerment themes.[7] Some themes of conscious hip hop include social conscience, Afrocentricity, religion, culture, the economy, depictions of the struggles of ordinary people, and aversion to or commentary on crime and violence. Conscious hip hop often seeks to raise awareness of social issues, sometimes leaving the listeners to form their own opinions rather than advocating for certain ideas and demanding actions like political hip hop.[6] Conscious hip hop artists often use their music to express their views on a wide range of topics, including politics, race, poverty, and the environment.

Some well-known examples of conscious hip hop artists include Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, J. Cole, Tom MacDonald, and Kendrick Lamar. These artists are known for their thoughtful and thought-provoking lyrics, often tackling complex and controversial issues.

In contrast to certain stereotypical views of mainstream hip hop, which is often associated with materialism and violence, conscious hip hop is often seen as a more positive and uplifting form of the genre. Conscious hip hop in reality is often bleakly realistic due to its focus on social issues. Despite frequent serious and bleak commentary, many conscious hip hop artists strive to inspire their listeners to think critically and make positive changes in their communities and the world.[citation needed]

Overall, conscious hip hop is a significant part of the hip hop landscape, and its artists continue to play a key role in raising awareness about important social and political issues.[8]

Before the emergence of political hip hop, the Black Power Movement and the emphasis on black pride arising in the mid-1960s inspired several commentaries incorporating Black Power ideological elements. Songs expressing the theme of black pride include James Brown's ""Say it Loud (I'm Black and Proud)"" (1969) and Billy Paul's ""Am I Black Enough for You?"" (1972). The proto-rap of Gil Scott-Heron is an early influence on political and conscious rap, however, most of his earlier socially conscious and political albums fall within the jazz, soul, and funk genres. Following Ronald Reagan’s election as President in 1980, conditions in inner-city African-American communities worsened, and hip hop political commentators began to increasingly address worsening social problems such as mass unemployment, police brutality, incarceration, inadequate public schools, political apathy, and oppression.[9] One of the first socially conscious hip hop songs was ""How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?"" by Brother D with Collective Effort.[10] One of the most successful early hip hop conscious rap songs was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's ""The Message"", an influential political and conscious hip hop track, decrying the poverty, violence, and dead-end lives of the urban poor of the time. The 1985 film Rappin' saw a more political dimension to hip hop, including some verses of Ice-T's rap Killers, his first political record. Furthermore, the complex socio-political issues before hip hop and during all of its stages severely influenced its birth and direction.[11]

Early gangsta rap often showed significant overlap with political and conscious rap.[12] Pioneers in the gangsta rap genre such as Ice-T, N.W.A., Ice Cube, and the Geto Boys blended the crime stories, violent imagery, and aggression associated with gangsta rap with socio-political commentary. Using the now standard gangsta rap motifs of crime and violence, they were able to comment on the state of society and expose issues found within poor communities and society as a whole.[13] These early gangsta rap artists were influenced in part by the bleak and often ""revolutionary"" crime novels of Iceberg Slim as well as hip hop groups such as Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions; groups that mixed aggressive, confrontational lyrics about urban life with social-political commentary and often radical political messages. The controversial debut album Straight Outta Compton by N.W.A, released in 1988 brought gangsta rap to the mainstream, but it also contained harsh social and political commentary, including the confrontational track ""Fuck tha Police."" Ice-T's work would sometimes focus on other topics: for example, he rapped about free speech on his third album, and about drunk driving, domestic violence, and Nelson Mandela on his fourth album.[14]

After his departure from the group N.W.A in 1989, Ice Cube embarked on a solo career and released socio-political and conscious rap with gangsta rap elements in his 1990 debut album Amerikkka's Most Wanted and the companion EP Kill at Will; the 1991 album Death Certificate; followed by the 1992 album, The Predator.[15] Furthermore, Ice Cube produced and appeared on the controversial and radical political rap/gangsta rap album Guerillas in tha Mist by Da Lench Mob in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.[15] Though Ice Cube would continue to sporadically insert political and social commentary into his music throughout his career, he once again focused on conscious and political rap with his 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later[15] and 2008's Raw Footage, featuring the single ""Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It"", a song dealing with the perceived correlation between music and global issues (e.g. the Iraq War, school shootings, etc.).

Underground rap, also known as underground hip hop, is a subgenre of hip hop known for its political and socially conscious lyrics. Unlike mainstream rap, which often focuses on themes such as money, power, and fame, underground rap addresses more serious and often controversial topics, such as racism, police brutality, and social inequality.[4]

Underground rap artists are often critical of their government and its policies, and use their music to express their political views. Many underground rap songs are highly political, and the lyrics often reflect the artists' personal experiences and perspectives on social and political issues. For example, some songs may address specific incidents of police brutality, while others may discuss the effects of poverty and inequality on communities of color.[9]

One of the main goals of underground rap is to challenge mainstream narratives and to provide an alternative voice to those who are often marginalized or ignored by mainstream media. Many underground rap artists are activists in their own right, and they often use their music to raise awareness about important social and political issues.[citation needed]

In addition to addressing political and social issues, underground rap is known for its emphasis on artistic creativity and individuality. In contrast to mainstream rap, which often follows a formulaic approach, underground rap is more diverse and experimental in its sound and style. This allows underground rap artists to express themselves in unique and innovative ways and to create music that is truly original and authentic.[16]

Underground rap is an important sub-genre of hip hop that provides a platform for artists to discuss important political and social issues while challenging mainstream narratives. By using their music to express their views and experiences, underground rap artists can raise awareness about important issues and inspire others to take action.[4]

The artists who consistently produce conscious rap are largely considered underground.[17][18] However, mainstream artists are increasingly including elements of conscious hip hop in their songs.[19] There are hundreds of artists whose music could be described as ""political"" or who identify as political rappers: see the list of political hip hop artists page for a partial list.[20]

Hip hop's impact on the political world is widespread. The response from mainstream politics has resulted in the spread of ideas, and opinions, and the formation of an informal dialogue surrounding largely controversial topics.

From the onset of hip hop in the 1980s throughout the 1990s, hip hop culture was either ignored or criticized by politicians. In the 1990s, the cultural idea that rap music was a symptom of the ""destruction of American values""  received bipartisan support.[21]  In 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle called on Interscope Records to withdraw 2Pacalypse Now because it was a ""disgrace to American music"". The catalyst for Quayle's outrage was an incident when a Texas youth shot a state trooper and referenced the album as his motivation.[21] In 2Pacalypse Now, rapper Tupac Shakur raised issues of institutional racism, teen pregnancy, and police brutality.[22] In the song ""Trapped"", he tells a fictional story of how a police officer slams him on the ground without cause, but before he gets arrested the police officer is shot. His lyrics read ""how can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?""

Throughout the 2000s, hip hop music has become a larger part of mainstream culture and is seen as more acceptable in the political sphere. In 2015, The Washington Post wrote ""The politician's guide to how to be down with hip hop""  which draws reference to the use of hip hop culture in politics.[23] Criticism of hip hop that was considered moral and patriotic one generation ago, can make a politician seem ""out of touch"", especially with younger voters.[23] Politician Mike Huckabee was viewed as being ""out of touch"" when he referred to Beyoncé as ""mental poison"" in his book: God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.[24] In 2008, during Barack Obama's Democratic primary campaign against then-rival Hillary Clinton, he referenced Jay-Z by doing his Dirt off Your Shoulder motion in a rally and the audience erupted with support.[25] The embrace of hip hop has occurred across party lines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is a vocal fan of Tupac and gangsta rap. Rubio said ""In some ways rappers are like reporters... You had gang wars, racial tension, and they were reporting on that.""[21] 45th President of the United States Donald Trump leveraged hip hop to his advantage during his 2016 election campaign. He occasionally quoted that rapper Mac Miller wrote a song called ""Donald Trump"", and that it has over 100,000,000 views.[23]

In the 2018 midterm elections, lawyer and former rapper Antonio Delgado was elected to New York's 19th congressional district.[26]

As hip hop is a music genre originally created and dominated by African-Americans, political rappers often reference and discuss Black liberation and the Black power movement. Numerous hip hop songs are expressing anti-racist views, such as the popular The Black Eyed Peas song ""Where Is the Love?"", however, artists advocating more for radical Black liberation have remained controversial. Artists such as Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, Game, and Kendrick Lamar have advocated Black liberation in their lyrics and poetry. In Tupac Shakur's poem, ""How Can We Be Free"", Shakur discusses the sacrifices of Black political prisoners and the rejection of patriotic symbols. Artists in the 2010, such as Killer Mike and Kendrick Lamar, have released songs criticizing the war on drugs and the prison industrial complex from an anti-racist perspective. Hip hop music continues to draw the attention and support of the struggles of minority groups in a modern method of communication that attracts a young demographic of activists. Kendrick Lamar and many other rappers have been credited with creating discussions regarding ""Blackness"" through their music.[27]

Particularly with the advent of gangsta rap, many hip hop artists come from underclass backgrounds. The aforementioned artists, such as Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, and Killer Mike have made just as much reference to class oppression as racial oppression. Tupac Shakur incorporates themes of revolutionary nationalism in his lyrics. In ""Words of Wisdom"" from the album 2Pacalypse Now,  Shakur's lyrics underscore the refusal to accept economic inequality and inadequate employment opportunities. Other political rappers, such as Public Enemy, The Dope Poet Society, Emcee London, Dead Prez, The Coup, Rebel Diaz, Paris, Sun Rise Above, and Immortal Technique, have advocated explicitly communist views—mostly leaning to Maoism[citation needed]—whereas some rappers such as Lupe Fiasco, Emcee Lynx, P.O.S, and Sole have advocated anarchist positions.[citation needed] Political references have long been made in hip hop culture; some proving to be effective in spurring constructive discussion and others, such as The Coup's originally planned album cover for Party Music—which depicted the destruction of The World Trade Center to signify the fall of capitalism—receiving negative criticisms (although the album art was designed before the September 11 attacks and was changed prior to its November 2001 release). Justice by Emcee London address corruption amongst Kenyan political class.[citation needed]

Conspiracy theories have been referenced in hip hop lyrics for some time. Elements of the Five-Percenter philosophy, which include a number of conspiracy theories, have significantly influenced hip hop culture. Artists such as Professor Griff, Jedi Mind Tricks, Hopsin, and Hyro the Hero have become infamous for their support of New World Order, Illuminati, and Satanist conspiracy theories, often alleging mainstream hip hop artists, such as Jay-Z, are ""involved"" in such conspiracies.[citation needed] Rapper B.o.B is a member of the Flat Earth Society.[28] Some artists, such as Public Enemy and dead prez, have been known to incorporate themes of government corruption and social injustice into their lyrics. In more recent years, artists like Killer Mike and J. Cole have also touched on these topics in their music.[4]

Rappers often reference their religious views. Outside of Five-Percenters and Black Muslims, they rarely translate into political views.[citation needed] Killer Mike, however, has been heavily critical of organized religion in many of his more political songs.[29] Chicago-raised rapper Kanye West's Life of Pablo album is another that offers an outlet for religious expression and self-assessment. In January 2019, West began hosting ""Sunday Service"" events where fans and invited guests can come to listen to choir renditions of his music, gospel songs, and pray.[30]

On a global scale, hip hop's public reputation and exhibition is varied. For instance, Canada's most prominent political hip hop act is The Dope Poet Society, who are known for anti-racist and anti-war activism, as well as denouncing both liberal and conservative politicians. Their politics could be described as third-worldism, or black internationalism. For example, in ""Bombay to Zimbabwe,"" lead rapper Professor D states ""from Bombay to Zimbabwe I study sharply: Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey, Mahatma Gandhi, Black Panther Party.""[31] Possibly on purpose, these influences seem ideologically contradictory in some ways (e.g. for instance, Marley's subtle socialism vs. Garvey's anti-communism, and non-violence vs. violence) but taken together they represent different approaches to the shared goal of linking anti-racist and anti-colonial struggles in the Americas and the rest of the world. Professor D and The Dope Poet Society also seem to represent this ideology on their album by featuring American political rappers like dead prez and others with rappers from around the world including Nigeria and Colombia. Other examples of hip hop around the world offer opposite perspectives. For example, Lowkey and Iron Sheik have expressed anti-Zionist views in their music, whereas Golan and Subliminal have expressed pro-Zionist views.[32] In France, some political artists such as Suprême NTM, the rapper Casey or Assassin are well known since the early-1990s. Today, rappers like Kery James, La Rumeur, Rocé or Médine are influential; their lyrics speak about colonialism, poverty, and French history.[citation needed]

Political rappers of Hispanic, Brazilian or Portuguese descent include Calle 13, Racionais MC's, Olmeca, Tohil, Immortal Technique, Rebel Diaz, Manny Phesto, MRK, Portavoz, Facção Central, Psycho Realm, Ana Tijoux, Bocafloja, Zack de la Rocha, Pablo Hasél (Spain), Los Chikos del Maiz (from Valencia, Spain), and Canserbero.

Within the United Kingdom hip hop and Grime music scene, political, conscious rap is common, with artists including Lowkey, who focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict and other issues regarding the Middle East, Logic, Akala, I & Ideal, Mic Righteous, Klashnekoff, Mic Reckless, Riz MC and English Frank.

Before the snap election on June 8, 2017, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn met with JME while campaigning for the Labour Party to encourage young people to register to vote.[33] During the interview, JME explained that many young voters don't feel as though politicians have their best interests at heart. He said they often feel that voting makes no difference anyway. He went on to tell Corbyn that he is the first party leader he feels he can trust, because he is ""so genuine it feels like I’m about to meet my mum’s friend"".[34]

Indigenous rappers Briggs and his collaboration with Trials for A.B. Original is one of the most prominent political hip hop artists in Australia. Artists Urthboy, Jimblah, The Herd, Horrorshow, and L-FRESH the Lion are all part of the Elefant Traks record label, and often have politically motivated songs. Their main focuses are racism and xenophobia but The Herd also focuses on issues of climate, gender inequality and war. Quro's 2007 EP Goodnight Mr. Howard contains overtly political critique of the Howard government and its policies. Some artists have expressed views on domestic violence through their lyrics. One example is the all-female indigenous hip hop group, Oetha, in their 2019 song Disturbing the Peace.[35]

Music created by Norwegian rappers often become part public discourse, making them part of the political process. This includes songs, lyrics and performances within the hip hop genre. Hip Hop music can be seen as an integral part of the democratic public sphere processes.[36]

Political hip hop developed in Serbia during the UN embargo on FR Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The most popular political hip hop group in Serbia is Beogradski Sindikat.[citation needed] The controversial song ""Порука Шиптарима"" (Translated to English: ""Message for Albanians"") started a boom of political hip hop in Serbia. During the 2000s, political hip hop was at its peak because of the political situation in the country. In the 2010s, political hip hop declined in popularity but remained a popular genre in the country. In 2020, there was an uptick in political hip hop discussing issues such as the 2020 elections and the COVID-19 pandemic.[citation needed]

Due to the long history of human rights violations in Iran, many Iranian rappers address contemporary social and political issues through their music. Some well-known examples of Iranian political hip hop artists include Hichkas, Fadaei, Shapur, Quf, Yas, and Toomaj Salehi. Since it is illegal to criticize the government and social issues in Iran, most of the Iranian rappers live abroad.[37]

Rapper Toomaj Salehi, who lives in Iran, was arrested during the Mahsa Amini protests on October 30, 2022, for his social awareness activities on his social media and releasing two protest songs ""Battleground"" and ""Omen"" during the protests.[38] On November 27, 2022, Iranian media revealed that Salehi was charged with ""corruption on Earth"", an offense which could carry the death penalty.[39] Salehi became one of the well-known faces of the revolutionary movement ""Woman, Life, Freedom"", denouncing the repression by the Iranian government. He has since been reportedly in solitary confinement and under torture.[40][41]"
"Political hip hop","

Political hip hop (also known as political rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that was developed in the 1980s as a way of turning hip hop into a form of political activism. Political hip hop generally uses the medium of hip hop music to comment on sociopolitical issues and send political messages to inspire action, create social change, or to convince the listener of a particular worldview. It was inspired partially by politically-focused 1970s artists such as The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron, as well as the Black Power movement and revolutionary politics of the 1960s and 1970s. Various hip hop artists emerged in the late 1980s espousing political messages and providing social and political commentary with KRS-One and his group Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy in particular establishing themselves as some of the first predominantly political hip hop groups with albums in 1988. Soon to follow in 1989 and following years were other Political rappers, or known as ""Conscious rap"" including such groups as X-Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers, Paris (rapper), Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and others  [1] The genre has helped to create a new form of social expression for subordinate groups to speak about their exclusions, injustices, and lack of power.[2][3]

There is no all-encompassing political hip hop ideology, rather, there are multiple perspectives that range anywhere from anarchism to Marxism to the values of the Five-Percent Nation. Hip hop and politics have long been intertwined, with many hip hop artists using their music as a means to speak out about political and social issues and express their views on current events. Over the years, there have been a number of hip hop songs that have addressed political issues such as police brutality, racism, and poverty, among others. Some well-known examples of political hip hop songs include:

[4][5]

Many hip hop artists have also been involved in political activism outside of their music. For example, Chuck D of Public Enemy has been involved in a number of political campaigns and organizations, and has used his music and public platform to speak out about issues such as police brutality and racism. Similarly, rapper and activist Common has been involved in a number of social justice causes, and has used his music to address issues such as police violence and racial inequality.[4]

Conscious hip hop (also known as socially conscious hip hop or conscious rap) is a subgenre of hip hop that challenges the dominant cultural, social, political, sociopolitical, philosophical, and economic consensus,[6] and/or comments on or focuses on social issues and conflicts. Conscious hip hop is not necessarily overtly political, but the terms ""conscious hip hop"" and ""political hip hop"" are frequently used interchangeably, and conscious hip hop may often be implicitly political. Conscious hip hop began to gain traction in the 1980s, along with hip hop in general. The term ""nation-conscious rap"" has been used to more specifically describe conscious hip hop music with certain strong political messages and themes, especially Black empowerment themes.[7] Some themes of conscious hip hop include social conscience, Afrocentricity, religion, culture, the economy, depictions of the struggles of ordinary people, and aversion to or commentary on crime and violence. Conscious hip hop often seeks to raise awareness of social issues, sometimes leaving the listeners to form their own opinions rather than advocating for certain ideas and demanding actions like political hip hop.[6] Conscious hip hop artists often use their music to express their views on a wide range of topics, including politics, race, poverty, and the environment.

Some well-known examples of conscious hip hop artists include Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, J. Cole, Tom MacDonald, and Kendrick Lamar. These artists are known for their thoughtful and thought-provoking lyrics, often tackling complex and controversial issues.

In contrast to certain stereotypical views of mainstream hip hop, which is often associated with materialism and violence, conscious hip hop is often seen as a more positive and uplifting form of the genre. Conscious hip hop in reality is often bleakly realistic due to its focus on social issues. Despite frequent serious and bleak commentary, many conscious hip hop artists strive to inspire their listeners to think critically and make positive changes in their communities and the world.[citation needed]

Overall, conscious hip hop is a significant part of the hip hop landscape, and its artists continue to play a key role in raising awareness about important social and political issues.[8]

Before the emergence of political hip hop, the Black Power Movement and the emphasis on black pride arising in the mid-1960s inspired several commentaries incorporating Black Power ideological elements. Songs expressing the theme of black pride include James Brown's ""Say it Loud (I'm Black and Proud)"" (1969) and Billy Paul's ""Am I Black Enough for You?"" (1972). The proto-rap of Gil Scott-Heron is an early influence on political and conscious rap, however, most of his earlier socially conscious and political albums fall within the jazz, soul, and funk genres. Following Ronald Reagan’s election as President in 1980, conditions in inner-city African-American communities worsened, and hip hop political commentators began to increasingly address worsening social problems such as mass unemployment, police brutality, incarceration, inadequate public schools, political apathy, and oppression.[9] One of the first socially conscious hip hop songs was ""How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?"" by Brother D with Collective Effort.[10] One of the most successful early hip hop conscious rap songs was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's ""The Message"", an influential political and conscious hip hop track, decrying the poverty, violence, and dead-end lives of the urban poor of the time. The 1985 film Rappin' saw a more political dimension to hip hop, including some verses of Ice-T's rap Killers, his first political record. Furthermore, the complex socio-political issues before hip hop and during all of its stages severely influenced its birth and direction.[11]

Early gangsta rap often showed significant overlap with political and conscious rap.[12] Pioneers in the gangsta rap genre such as Ice-T, N.W.A., Ice Cube, and the Geto Boys blended the crime stories, violent imagery, and aggression associated with gangsta rap with socio-political commentary. Using the now standard gangsta rap motifs of crime and violence, they were able to comment on the state of society and expose issues found within poor communities and society as a whole.[13] These early gangsta rap artists were influenced in part by the bleak and often ""revolutionary"" crime novels of Iceberg Slim as well as hip hop groups such as Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions; groups that mixed aggressive, confrontational lyrics about urban life with social-political commentary and often radical political messages. The controversial debut album Straight Outta Compton by N.W.A, released in 1988 brought gangsta rap to the mainstream, but it also contained harsh social and political commentary, including the confrontational track ""Fuck tha Police."" Ice-T's work would sometimes focus on other topics: for example, he rapped about free speech on his third album, and about drunk driving, domestic violence, and Nelson Mandela on his fourth album.[14]

After his departure from the group N.W.A in 1989, Ice Cube embarked on a solo career and released socio-political and conscious rap with gangsta rap elements in his 1990 debut album Amerikkka's Most Wanted and the companion EP Kill at Will; the 1991 album Death Certificate; followed by the 1992 album, The Predator.[15] Furthermore, Ice Cube produced and appeared on the controversial and radical political rap/gangsta rap album Guerillas in tha Mist by Da Lench Mob in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.[15] Though Ice Cube would continue to sporadically insert political and social commentary into his music throughout his career, he once again focused on conscious and political rap with his 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later[15] and 2008's Raw Footage, featuring the single ""Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It"", a song dealing with the perceived correlation between music and global issues (e.g. the Iraq War, school shootings, etc.).

Underground rap, also known as underground hip hop, is a subgenre of hip hop known for its political and socially conscious lyrics. Unlike mainstream rap, which often focuses on themes such as money, power, and fame, underground rap addresses more serious and often controversial topics, such as racism, police brutality, and social inequality.[4]

Underground rap artists are often critical of their government and its policies, and use their music to express their political views. Many underground rap songs are highly political, and the lyrics often reflect the artists' personal experiences and perspectives on social and political issues. For example, some songs may address specific incidents of police brutality, while others may discuss the effects of poverty and inequality on communities of color.[9]

One of the main goals of underground rap is to challenge mainstream narratives and to provide an alternative voice to those who are often marginalized or ignored by mainstream media. Many underground rap artists are activists in their own right, and they often use their music to raise awareness about important social and political issues.[citation needed]

In addition to addressing political and social issues, underground rap is known for its emphasis on artistic creativity and individuality. In contrast to mainstream rap, which often follows a formulaic approach, underground rap is more diverse and experimental in its sound and style. This allows underground rap artists to express themselves in unique and innovative ways and to create music that is truly original and authentic.[16]

Underground rap is an important sub-genre of hip hop that provides a platform for artists to discuss important political and social issues while challenging mainstream narratives. By using their music to express their views and experiences, underground rap artists can raise awareness about important issues and inspire others to take action.[4]

The artists who consistently produce conscious rap are largely considered underground.[17][18] However, mainstream artists are increasingly including elements of conscious hip hop in their songs.[19] There are hundreds of artists whose music could be described as ""political"" or who identify as political rappers: see the list of political hip hop artists page for a partial list.[20]

Hip hop's impact on the political world is widespread. The response from mainstream politics has resulted in the spread of ideas, and opinions, and the formation of an informal dialogue surrounding largely controversial topics.

From the onset of hip hop in the 1980s throughout the 1990s, hip hop culture was either ignored or criticized by politicians. In the 1990s, the cultural idea that rap music was a symptom of the ""destruction of American values""  received bipartisan support.[21]  In 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle called on Interscope Records to withdraw 2Pacalypse Now because it was a ""disgrace to American music"". The catalyst for Quayle's outrage was an incident when a Texas youth shot a state trooper and referenced the album as his motivation.[21] In 2Pacalypse Now, rapper Tupac Shakur raised issues of institutional racism, teen pregnancy, and police brutality.[22] In the song ""Trapped"", he tells a fictional story of how a police officer slams him on the ground without cause, but before he gets arrested the police officer is shot. His lyrics read ""how can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?""

Throughout the 2000s, hip hop music has become a larger part of mainstream culture and is seen as more acceptable in the political sphere. In 2015, The Washington Post wrote ""The politician's guide to how to be down with hip hop""  which draws reference to the use of hip hop culture in politics.[23] Criticism of hip hop that was considered moral and patriotic one generation ago, can make a politician seem ""out of touch"", especially with younger voters.[23] Politician Mike Huckabee was viewed as being ""out of touch"" when he referred to Beyoncé as ""mental poison"" in his book: God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.[24] In 2008, during Barack Obama's Democratic primary campaign against then-rival Hillary Clinton, he referenced Jay-Z by doing his Dirt off Your Shoulder motion in a rally and the audience erupted with support.[25] The embrace of hip hop has occurred across party lines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is a vocal fan of Tupac and gangsta rap. Rubio said ""In some ways rappers are like reporters... You had gang wars, racial tension, and they were reporting on that.""[21] 45th President of the United States Donald Trump leveraged hip hop to his advantage during his 2016 election campaign. He occasionally quoted that rapper Mac Miller wrote a song called ""Donald Trump"", and that it has over 100,000,000 views.[23]

In the 2018 midterm elections, lawyer and former rapper Antonio Delgado was elected to New York's 19th congressional district.[26]

As hip hop is a music genre originally created and dominated by African-Americans, political rappers often reference and discuss Black liberation and the Black power movement. Numerous hip hop songs are expressing anti-racist views, such as the popular The Black Eyed Peas song ""Where Is the Love?"", however, artists advocating more for radical Black liberation have remained controversial. Artists such as Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, Ice Cube, Game, and Kendrick Lamar have advocated Black liberation in their lyrics and poetry. In Tupac Shakur's poem, ""How Can We Be Free"", Shakur discusses the sacrifices of Black political prisoners and the rejection of patriotic symbols. Artists in the 2010, such as Killer Mike and Kendrick Lamar, have released songs criticizing the war on drugs and the prison industrial complex from an anti-racist perspective. Hip hop music continues to draw the attention and support of the struggles of minority groups in a modern method of communication that attracts a young demographic of activists.

Justice by Emcee London address corruption amongst Kenyan political class.[citation needed]

Conspiracy theories have been referenced in hip hop lyrics for some time. Elements of the Five-Percenter philosophy, which include a number of conspiracy theories, have significantly influenced hip hop culture. Artists such as Professor Griff, Jedi Mind Tricks, Hopsin, and Hyro the Hero have become infamous for their support of New World Order, Illuminati, and Satanist conspiracy theories, often alleging mainstream hip hop artists, such as Jay-Z, are ""involved"" in such conspiracies.[citation needed] Rapper B.o.B is a member of the Flat Earth Society.[28] Some artists, such as Public Enemy and dead prez, have been known to incorporate themes of government corruption and social injustice into their lyrics.

Professor D and The Dope Poet Society also seem to represent this ideology on their album by featuring American political rappers like dead prez and others with rappers from around the world including Nigeria and Colombia. Other examples of hip hop around the world offer opposite perspectives.

"Pop rap","

Pop rap (also known as pop hip-hop, pop hop, melodic hip-hop or melodic rap) is a genre of music fusing the rhythm-based lyricism of hip-hop music with pop music's preference for melodious vocals and catchy tunes emphasizing on pop like productions and structure. The lyrics are often positive, with choruses similar to those heard in pop music. This genre gained mainstream popularity during the 1990s, though the influences and roots of pop rap can trace back to late-1980s hip-hop artists such as Run-DMC, LL Cool J, and Beastie Boys.

AllMusic describes pop rap as ""a marriage of hip hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks, which are usually featured as part of the chorus section in a standard pop-song structure.""[2] Pop rap also tends to have less aggressive lyrics than street-level rap music.[2][3] However, some 1990s artists fused pop rap with a more aggressive attitude to defuse backlash on their own accessibility.[2] Music journalist Wilson McBee has strongly criticized pop rap, ""A pop rapper is assumed to be a sellout – someone who has compromised artistic principles in order to fit commercial expectations. Or worse, it's someone who never had any artistic principles to begin with, who's guilty of bastardizing rap's social and political traditions just to make money."" McBee also then went on saying ""In labeling the likes of Flo Rida, Lupae Filius and other pop rappers, we blur the distinction between a 'pop rapper' and a rapper who is just really popular. Not every rapper who has a hit is automatically a sellout or deserving of the pop rap tag.""[4] While some rappers from the 1990s with catchy hooks have been compared to pop music, McBee also said: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}

In 1994, both Coolio's ""Fantastic Voyage"" and Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Big Poppa"" were big hits. Both featured plush, synthesizer-heavy production, catchy hooks and lyrics about partying. But the songs are not even close to being siblings. Coolio's awkward verses are nearly void of internal rhyming, interesting metaphors or lyrical variation whatsoever. The imagery is tired, vague and familiar: “We’re going to a place where everybody kick it/ Kick it, kick it . . . yeah that’s the ticket.” Compare that with these vivid lines from Biggie: “So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly / A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch’s grape.” ""Big Poppa"" may have a poppy melody and beat, but it is still the work of a masterful lyricist and storyteller.[4]

Pop rap songs often have lyrical content similar to that in pop with themes such as love and relationships.[4]

In the 1980s, rap artists including Run DMC and LL Cool J set up the blueprints and origins of pop rap as they suddenly broke into the mainstream.[2][3] LL Cool J has been described as the first ""pop rapper"" in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985 debut album Radio. Paramount-owned music video channel MTV has described LL Cool J's 1987 single ""I Need Love"" as ""one of the first pop rap crossover hits"".[5] Later, rap artists such as Tone Loc, Young MC, and Fresh Prince then made party tunes and used their storytelling abilities as they became popular. During the 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to connect strongly with dance music and R&B.[2][3]

In the early 1990s, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice broke into the mainstream with songs such as ""U Can't Touch This"" and ""Ice Ice Baby"", respectively, but the two sampled from both songs of the 1980s.[6] They caused pop rap to be ""derided (and, occasionally, taken to court) for its willingness to borrow"" from best-known hit singles.[2] Another important moment was the remix of Mariah Carey's 1995 song ""Fantasy"" with Ol' Dirty Bastard.[7]

By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, rappers such as Ja Rule fused gangsta rap themes with 1980s pop and soul elements; pop rap was dominated by many artists.[2] It then went back into the mainstream with the success of the Black Eyed Peas who had smash singles such as ""Where Is the Love?"" (2003) from their breakthrough album Elephunk.[1]

During the late 2000s and early 2010s, many rap artists who used pop rap in their music had emerged such as Nicki Minaj, Drake, will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas, Redfoo, Flo Rida and Wiz Khalifa.[4][8]

Most people who listen to pop rap do not call it pop rap, and simply consider it as rap.[9] When Spotify introduced the pop rap category in 2019, Twitter users were confused as to what this 'new' genre suggested. Some users were even bewildered when Spotify classified the genre for its users and suggested that they listen to pop rap.[10] Popular hip-hop rapper LL Cool J did not embrace the idea of labeling him as the ""forefather of pop rap"" and tweeted about it in April 2021.[11][12]"""""
"Rap rock","

Rap rock is a music genre that developed from the early to mid-1980s, when hip hop DJs incorporated rock records into their routines and rappers began incorporating original and sampled rock instrumentation into hip hop music. Rap rock is considered to be rock music in which lyrics are rapped, rather than sung. The genre achieved its greatest success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

AllMusic characterized rap rock songs as rock songs in which the vocals were rapped rather than sung.[1]AllMusic also states that the rhythms of rap rock are rooted in those of hip hop, with more funk influences than normal hard rock.[1] Session player Eddie Martinez, who created the guitar parts for hip hop group Run-DMC's rap rock song ""Rock Box"", recognized that ""a rap-rock song needn't feature a new change in the chorus; rather, it's a spot where the guitarist can just solo over the same riff that drives the verses.""[2]

Rap rock is often conflated with rap metal, but while the two styles may appear to have minute differences, AllMusic says that rap rock has ""organic, integrated"" hip hop elements, while rap metal features ""big, lurching beats and heavy, heavy riffs"" and has a tendency to sound ""as if the riffs were merely overdubbed over scratching and beat box beats.""[1]AllMusic says that old school rap rock had more in common with ""hardcore punk or artsy post-punk with breakbeats"" than with metal.[3]

Early hip hop DJs utilized breaks from rock records, such as Billy Squier's ""the Big Beat"", the Monkees' ""Mary, Mary"" and Steve Miller Band's ""Take the Money and Run"", in order to ""flaunt their vinyl guile"".[5] Impressed by post-punk band Public Image Ltd.'s incorporation of dub elements into their music, hip hop artist Afrika Bambaataa collaborated with the band's singer John Lydon on the single ""World Destruction"".[2] The post-punk and new wave scenes also saw the early rap rock recordings ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""This is Radio Clash"" by the Clash, influenced by Grandmaster Flash and the Sugarhill Gang,[5][6] and the new-wave rap song ""Rapture"" by Blondie.[5] Although the Cold Crush Brothers' ""Punk Rock Rap"" did not see much success and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five would wind up being jeered opening for the Clash, Run-DMC saw a crossover audience with their rap rock sound, helping gain rock fans' acceptance of hip hop.[5] Subsequently, Public Enemy would further unite hip hop and punk rock audiences, ""with their rough, hard-hitting boom-bap sound resonating with both black kids in the inner cities and white kids in the suburbs"".[7] Public Enemy brought a punk rock attitude to hip hop;[4] frontman Chuck D cited punk band the Clash's triple album Sandinista! as a release that made him take notice of hip hop.[6] Another link between hip hop and punk rock was producer Rick Rubin, who split his time between working with hip hop artists Run-DMC and Beastie Boys, and punk-influenced bands like Slayer and the Cult.[7]

Although hip hop music would gain popularity in the 1980s, many dismissed it as either bring a fad, or as a marginal art form which appealed only to urban African Americans.[8] However, a rap rock collaboration between Run-DMC and the rock band Aerosmith helped diminish such biases.[8] The 1986 single ""Walk This Way"", a remake of Aerosmith's 1975 rock song, helped bring hip hop into popularity with a mainstream white audience.[9] It was the first Billboard top ten rap rock success played on radio.[10] The music video signaled ""both a literal and metaphoric merging of hard rock and rap""; the recording revitalized Aerosmith's career.[8] The same year that Run-DMC released ""Walk This Way"", Beastie Boys released their debut album, Licensed to Ill, ""a head-banging party album that enjoyed multi-platinum sales"".[8] According to CNN, the album ""essentially invented rap-rock"",[4] as demonstrated by songs like ""Rhymin' and Stealin'"", which was built around samples from Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and the Clash, ""(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)"" and ""No Sleep till Brooklyn"", which featured guitar playing by Slayer's Kerry King.[4] Also that year, rap rock band Urban Dance Squad formed, and according to AllMusic writer Heather Phares, the band's ""mix of rock, rap, funk, ska, folk, hip-hop, and soul signaled the trend toward genre-bending that prevailed in '90s music.""[11] Public Enemy's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back contained a song which sampled Slayer, and in 1991, the hip hop group would re-record their song ""Bring the Noise"" with the metal band Anthrax,[8] a collaboration Spin deemed to be a weak retread of the ""Walk This Way"" collaboration.[5]

The 1990s saw rap rock achieving mainstream success.[8]Faith No More reached a large audience with their 1990 hit ""Epic"", in which the band's singer, Mike Patton, mixed singing and rapping.[8]Rage Against the Machine also saw success with rap rock music influenced by political hip hop.[8] According to the BBC, 1990s hip hop artists like Ice Cube, DMX and Onyx displayed the punk rock sensibilities of hip hop.[7] This period also saw Beastie Boys reinventing themselves by distancing themselves from the frat boy image they portrayed on their Licensed to Ill album; harkening back to the group's roots in hardcore punk, Beastie Boys began playing live instruments again on their 1992 album Check Your Head, a ""groundbreaking record that captured suburban skateboard culture with a goofy melding of rap, rock, funk, and thrash""[8] and this album, along with their follow-up, Ill Communication, demonstrated that rock, hip hop and jazz could coexist on a single album.[4] However, the genre had developed a bad aesthetic reputation, owing to ""a series of ill-advised, record-company driven projects""[2] which included the soundtrack album to the film Judgment Night (1993), which featured rock artists collaborating with rappers on every track, the results of which Slate described as being ""lumpy and uneven"" in its fusion of rap with grunge and metal; Slate wrote, ""the subsequent corporate rap rock of the '90s followed the blander, more conservative examples of fusion to be found on Judgment Night.""[2] In the book Is Hip Hop Dead? The Past, Present, and Future of America's Most Wanted Music, author Mickey Hess identifies Kid Rock as connecting hip hop music to rap rock, due to the musician having started out as a hip hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music.[12] After releasing ""two albums of pure Beastie Boys worship"",[13] including his first rap rock album, The Polyfuze Method (1993),[14] Kid Rock began to explore his Southern rock influences on Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp (1996), and Devil Without a Cause (1998) ""extended the lineage of rap-rock""[13] with an album that sold over 14 million copies,[15] and helped to ""ignite the rap-rock genre"".[16]

The late 1990s has been cited as rap rock's ""golden age"".[8] Separate from rap rock, but developing popularity around the same time in the late 1990s, was nu metal, which would ultimately be conflated with rap rock, although the two genres did not have much in common.[13] However, the Woodstock '99 festival and the band Limp Bizkit would wind up linking, as well as shifting critical opinion of both genres from the acclaim they'd initially received to near-universal disdain.[13] The band's frontman, Fred Durst, grew up with hip hop music, and Limp Bizkit would have a stronger connection to rap rock than any previous artist in nu metal, including having former House of Pain turntablist DJ Lethal as part of their line-up.[13][17] The release of Limp Bizkit's 1999 album Significant Other was pinpointed as a breakthrough for rap rock.[8] Selling more than more than 7 million copies, and featuring the hit single ""Nookie"" as well as a guest appearance by Wu-Tang Clan rapper Method Man, Significant Other demonstrated the commercial viability of rap rock by ""drawing from Rage's metallic aggression and the Beastie Boys' skateboard-slacker attitude"".[8] However, Limp Bizkit's performance at Woodstock '99 was linked to festival violence.[18] The festival featured performances by multiple rap rock artists, including Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse and Rage Against the Machine, all of which were considered the ""breakout stars"" of the festival.[17] However, despite these performances being well received, Limp Bizkit's performance was subject to national controversy as violence and vandalism occurred during and after the band's performance; this included fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of their song ""Break Stuff"".[19][20][21][22][23] Durst stated during the concert, ""Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up.""[20] Durst said during a performance of the band's hit song ""Nookie"", ""We already let all the negative energy out. Its time to reach down and bring that positive energy to this motherfucker. Its time to let yourself go right now, 'cause there are no motherfuckin' rules out there.""[24] Eyewitnesses also reported a crowd-surfing woman being pulled down into the crowd and assaulted in the mosh pit during Limp Bizkit's set.[25] Widely blamed for inciting the crowd to violence, Durst later stated in an interview, ""I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet [6 m] in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?""[20] Former Limp Bizkit manager Peter Katsis defended Durst in an interview for Netflix's 2022 documentary on the festival, claiming that ""pointing the finger at Fred is about the last thing anybody should do. There really isn't a way to control 300,000 people. The best thing he could do is put on the best show possible, and that's what he did.""[26]. Their third album, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[27] selling 1,054,511 copies in its first week of being released,[28][29] with 400,000 of those copies being sold in the album's first day of release [30] making it the largest first-week sales debut for a rock album in the United States.

Crazy Town was met with more ire from metal purists than any other rap rock band due to looking more like a hip hop crew than a metal band.[31] Crazy Town's music and image reflected the band members' background in the underground hip hop scene in Los Angeles, anticipating nu metal.[32][33] Their lyrics reflected ""one of the most dynamic and volatile sociocultural environments on the planet [...] where the urban squalor of the South Central district exists just minutes away from the glitz of Beverly Hills.""[32] Rapper KRS-One recorded a guest appearance for the band's debut album The Gift of Game.[32] Although Crazy Town were best known for having a rap metal sound, their biggest hit, ""Butterfly"", was ""decidedly hip-hop"".[34] ""Butterfly"" would be the only Hot 100 hit by a rap rock act.[35] According to Vulture, the 1990s were capped off by the short-lived late-90s sitcom Shasta McNasty, which encapsulated numerous 1990s trends in its depiction of a fictional rap rock band, brought the genre to primetime.[36]

The style of crunk developed by Lil Jon was categorized as a ""southern rap take on punk, which prioritised uncomfortably loud horns and repetitive screams.""[7]Linkin Park debuted in 2000 with their album Hybrid Theory and would continue to be the most visible rap rock group of the 21st century, going as far as to collaborate with rapper Jay-Z on the 2004 release Collision Course.[8] Subsequently, Kid Rock and Linkin Park's styles changed,[37] with Kid Rock having shifted to a country rock sound.[38]Hollywood Undead was seen as a revival of the rap rock sound, although they considered themselves a rock band with hip hop influences, rather than a rap rock band.[37]HotNewHipHop said that Kid Cudi blurred the lines between genres with his album Man on the Moon II (2010), which contained collaborations with indie rock artists St. Vincent and HAIM, and would deliver further into rock on his albums WZRD (2012) and Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven (2015).[39] The publication suggested that the negative reception to the latter two albums, as well as Lil Wayne's Rebirth (2010), were ""glaring examples of the music media immediately shutting down Black artists for stepping outside of the confines of what is deemed as 'Black music.'""[39] The publication also said that Lil Wayne's use of autotune on the album and its ""raw rock attitude"" would prove ""to be highly influential on the next generation of rap rockstars.""[39] By 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that rap rock ""seemed [...] dead"".[37] However, that year saw the release of several acclaimed rap rock projects, including Wugazi, a mashup mixtape in which raps by Wu-Tang Clan were paired with instrumentals by the band Fugazi,[2] and the rap rock mixtape Exmilitary by the band Death Grips, which ""[coupled] contemporary avant-rock techniques with underground rap sonics""; while some of the mixtape's samples and influences were more mainstream, such as a sample of a David Bowie song, most of the mixtape's samples came from American underground bands like Black Flag and Minutemen.[2]Twenty One Pilots, composed the rap rock songs ""Stressed Out"" and ""Heathens"", which both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2016.[40][41][42][43][44]

In 2017, Pitchfork wrote, ""if, at some point, you made a name for yourself through combining rap and rock, chances are you either distance yourself vigorously from such efforts now or have learned to adjust to life as a walking joke.""[18] In 2018, conversely, The A.V. Club wrote that ""rap-rock as we once knew it as dead"",[13] while HotNewHipHop said that the genre showed ""no signs of stopping"".[39] The late 2010s saw the emergence of female rap rock artists such as Princess Nokia, Rico Nasty and Bali Baby, diverging from the typically male-dominated rap rock acts of the past.[39]

In 2020, NME writer Kyann-Sian Williams reported a resurgence in rap rock, which fans dubbed ""glock rock"" due to the unfavorable reputation of rap rock.[45] Williams cited as representatives of glock rock, Lil Uzi Vert, a punk rock-influenced rapper who identified as a ""rockstar"" and cited Marilyn Manson as their all-time favorite musical artist,[45]Machine Gun Kelly, a rapper influenced by emo and pop punk,[45]City Morgue, a group that ""mixed thrash metal with pulsating 808s"",[45] as well as Trippie Redd, Post Malone, Clever and The Kid LAROI.[45] Also emerging in this period was Oxymorrons, a rap rock group described as being ""too rock for hip-hop [and] too hip-hop for rock"";[46]Kerrang! writer Sophie K. described them as ""a talented rock band who are able to properly rap with authenticity as well, seamlessly switching between clean vocals, electronics, fuzzy guitars and angsty rap vocals"".[47] 2020 saw many rappers dominating the rock charts.[48]"
"Rap metal","

Rap metal is a fusion genre which combines hip hop with heavy metal. It usually consists of heavy metal guitar riffs, funk metal elements, rapped vocals and sometimes turntables.

Rap metal's roots are based both in hip hop acts who sampled heavy metal music, such as Beastie Boys, MC Strecker[3]Cypress Hill,[4]Esham[5][6] and Run-DMC,[7] and rock bands who fused heavy metal and hip hop influences, such as 24-7 Spyz[8] and Faith No More.[9]

Scott Ian of Anthrax (who helped pioneer the genre) believes Rage Against the Machine invented the genre.[10]

In 1987, the heavy metal band Anthrax fused hip hop with heavy metal for their extended play I'm the Man.[11] The next year rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot teamed up with Metal Church for his 1988 single ""Iron Man"", from his debut album Swass, loosely based upon the Black Sabbath song of the same name.[2] Rap metal can be found in a track from the industrial metal band Ministry in their 1989 album The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste on the track ""Test"" for which they hired rappers The Grand Wizard (K. Lite) and The Slogan God (Tommie Boyskee) to perform vocals. In 1990, the rapper Ice-T formed a heavy metal band called Body Count, and while performing at the 1991 Lollapalooza tour performed a set that was half rap songs and half metal songs. Stuck Mojo and Clawfinger, both formed in 1989, are considered to be another two pioneers of the genre.[12][13] Anthrax in 1991 teamed up with Public Enemy for a remake of the latter's ""Bring the Noise"" that fused hip hop with thrash metal.[14] Also in 1991, the thrash metal band Tourniquet featured the hip hop group P.I.D. on the song ""Spineless"" from their album Psycho Surgery.[15][16]

In the 1990s, rap metal became a popular style of music. For instance, the band Faith No More's song ""Epic"" was a major success and peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.[17] 1993 saw the release of the Judgment Night soundtrack that featured numerous collaborations between rappers, musicians and rock and metal group of bands. Rage Against the Machine's 1996 album Evil Empire entered the Billboard 200 at number one, and in 1999, their third studio album, The Battle of Los Angeles, also debuted in top spot in the Billboard 200, selling 430,000 copies in its first week.[18] Each of the band's albums became at least platinum hits.[19]Biohazard played on the Ozzfest mainstage alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Slayer, Danzig, Fear Factory, and Sepultura. In support of the album, Biohazard embarked on a short co-headlining tour of Europe with Suicidal Tendencies.

On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released rap metal musician Kid Rock's Devil Without a Cause behind the single ""Welcome 2 the Party (Ode 2 the Old School)"" and Kid Rock went on the Vans Warped Tour to support the album. Sales of ""Welcome 2 The Party"" and Devil Without a Cause were slow, though the 1998 Warped Tour in Northampton, Massachusetts stimulated regional interest in Massachusetts and New England. This led to substantial airplay of the single ""I Am The Bullgod"" during the summer and fall of 1998 on Massachusetts rock staples WZLX and WAAF. In early December 1998, while DJing at a club, he met and became friends with MTV host Carson Daly. He talked Daly into getting him a performance on MTV and on December 28, 1998, he performed on MTV Fashionably Loud in Miami, Florida, creating a buzz from his performance, even upstaging Jay-Z. In May, his sales began taking off with the third single ""Bawitdaba"" and by April 1999, Devil Without a Cause had achieved a gold disc.[20] The following month, Devil, as he predicted, went platinum.[20] Kid Rock's first major tour was Limptropolis, where he opened for Limp Bizkit with Staind. He solidified his superstardom with a Woodstock 1999 performance and on July 24 of that year, he was double platinum.[20] The following single ""Cowboy"", a mix of southern rock, country, and rap, was an even bigger hit, making the Top 40. It even became the theme song of WCW's Jeff Jarrett. Rock's next single, the slow back porch blues ballad ""Only God Knows Why"", was the biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was one of the first songs to use the autotune effect. By the time the final single, ""Wasting Time"", was released, the album had sold 7 million copies. Devil Without a Cause was certified 11 times platinum by the RIAA on April 17, 2003.[20] According to Nielsen SoundScan, as of 2013, actual sales are 9.3 million. Kid Rock was nominated as Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards, but lost to Christina Aguilera. He was nominated for ""Bawitdaba"" for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost to Metallica's ""Whiskey in the Jar"". In 1998, Ice Cube released his long-awaited album War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc) which had some elements of nu metal and rap metal on some tracks.[21] The album debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 180,000 copies in the first week.[22]

It reached the height of its popularity during 1999,[23] with the Port Huron Times-Herald describing the summer of that year as a ""bipolar menu of harsh rap-metal and gooey teen pop.""[24] Around this time, the style started to attract criticism in the mainstream, particularly after the troubled Woodstock 1999 festival, which featured many artists associated with rap metal and nu/alternative metal, such as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine and Reveille.[25]Pop punk musician Jeff Brogowski told The Morning Call newspaper in 1999 that ""these macho rap-metal bands are just so mean-spirited. Look what happened at Woodstock (last summer). All the violence, looting and the fires. Something strange is going on. Maybe it has something do with all the economic prosperity. It's getting ugly like it was during the '80s, when so many people and bands were so cocky.""[26]

The nu/rap metal band Limp Bizkit's 1999 album Significant Other climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release.[27] In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.[27] The band's follow-up album, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album with over one million copies sold in the U.S. in its first week of release, with 400,000 of those sales coming on its first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam's Vs.[28] That same year, Papa Roach's major label debut Infest became a platinum hit.[29]Cypress Hill incorporated direct heavy metal influences into their 2000 album Skull & Bones, which featured six tracks in which rappers B-Real and Sen Dog were backed by a band including Fear Factory members Christian Olde Wolbers and Dino Cazares and Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk.[30] B-Real also formed a rap metal group, Kush, with Wolbers, Fear Factory drummer Raymond Herrera and Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter.[31][32] According to B-Real, Kush is more aggressive than other bands in the genre.[32]SX-10, formed in 1996 by Sen Dog, also performs rap rock and rap metal.[33]

In 2000, the rap metal band P.O.D.'s 1999 album The Fundamental Elements of Southtown went platinum[34] and was the 143rd best-selling album of 2000.[35] Late in 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album Hybrid Theory, which remains both the best-selling debut album by any artist in the 21st century, and the best-selling nu metal album of all time.[36] The album was also the best-selling album in all genres in 2001, offsetting sales by prominent pop acts like Backstreet Boys and N'Sync,[37] earning the band a Grammy Award for their second single ""Crawling"",[38] with the fourth single, ""In the End"", released late in 2001, becoming one of the most recognized songs in the first decade of the 21st century.[39][40] The rap rock band Crazy Town also broke into the mainstream success of nu metal with their 1999 album The Gift of Game, especially their number 1 hit single, ""Butterfly"", which peaked at number 1 on many charts including the Billboard Hot 100 during March 2001, remaining on the Hot 100 for 23 weeks.[41][42] It also peaked at number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and the Hot Dance Singles chart as well as peaking number 6 on the Rhythmic Top 40, number 2 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart and number 4 on the Top 40 Tracks chart.[43] Their album The Gift of Game peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200.[43] Worldwide the album sold more than 2.5 million units,[44] with more than 1.5 million in the US alone.[45] Also that year was Saliva's Every Six Seconds which was also a commercial success, debuting at no. 6 on the Billboard 200. In 2001, the band P.O.D.'s Satellite album went triple platinum[46] and peaked at #6 on the Billboard 200 chart.[47]

Proyecto Eskhata, a Spanish band which debuted in 2012, has received much press coverage in Spain for its fusion of progressive rock and rap metal, which journalists have described as ""progressive rap metal"".[48][49][50][51]

Nu metal (also known as nü-metal and aggro-metal) is a genre that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative metal, funk, industrial and groove metal. Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including rap metal and other heavy metal subgenres.

Trap metal (also known as ragecore, death rap,[52]hardcore trap, industrial trap and scream rap or screamo trap)[53][unreliable source?] is a fusion genre that combines elements of trap music and heavy metal,[54] as well as elements of other genres, like industrial[55] and nu metal.[56] It is characterized by distorted beats, hip hop flows, harsh vocals, and down tuned heavy metal guitars.[54][57][58]Bones has been considered by Kerrang! to be one of the earliest practitioners of the genre, performing trap metal tracks beginning around 2014.[59] British rapper Scarlxrd is often associated with the genre and is considered a pioneer of trap metal.[60][61][54][59]WQHT described OG Maco's 2014 eponymous EP as being a part of the genre's early development.[62] Other artists associated with trap metal include Dropout Kings,[63]Bone Crew,[64]Ghostemane,[59]ZillaKami,[65]Fever 333,[66]Ho99o9,[67]City Morgue,[68]Kid Bookie,[69]Kim Dracula,[70]Backxwash,[71]Banshee,[72]Denzel Curry,[73] and $uicideboy$,[52] as well as the early careers of XXXTentacion, 6ix9ine[74] and Ski Mask the Slump God.[75]

The stylistic influences of trap metal vary widely, with some artists such as City Morgue and Ho99o9 drawing influence from hardcore punk,[65][67] while other artists such as Ghostemane have pioneered their own sounds with influences from genres including black metal, gothic rock, industrial metal, and emo.[76]"
"Southern hip hop","

Southern hip hop, also known as Southern rap, South Coast hip hop, or dirty south, is a blanket term for a regional genre of American hip hop music that emerged in the Southern United States, especially in Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, Memphis, and Miami—five cities which constitute the ""Southern Network"" in rap music.[1][2][3]

The music was a reaction to the 1980s flow of hip hop culture from New York City and the Los Angeles area and can be considered the third major American hip hop scene, alongside East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop.[4] Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on mixtapes after encountering difficulty securing record-label contracts in the 1990s.[5] By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had attained success, and as the decade went on, both mainstream and underground varieties of Southern hip hop became among the most popular and influential of the entire genre.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the American hip hop music market was primarily dominated by artists from the East Coast and West Coast. Los Angeles and New York City were the two main cities where hip hop was receiving widespread attention. The West Coast was mainly represented by groups like N.W.A., Death Row Records, and the East Coast had people like The Notorious B.I.G. and groups like the Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and Bad Boy Records.[6] In the mid 1980s, cities throughout the Southern United States began to catch on to the hip hop music movement.[6] The Geto Boys, a hip hop group from Houston, were among the first hip hop artists from the Southern United States to gain widespread popularity. Southern hip hop's roots can be traced to the success of the group's Grip It! On That Other Level in 1989, the Rick Rubin-produced The Geto Boys in 1990, and We Can't Be Stopped in 1991.[7]

By the mid-1990s, Atlanta had become a center in Southern hip hop music. Local production crews such as Organized Noize that represented hip hop groups such as OutKast and Goodie Mob played a huge part in helping the South become a center for hip hop music.[8][9][10]

A defining moment for Southern rap was at the 1995 Source Awards. The duo Outkast had just been awarded Best New Artist, and within the tension that was the East Coast–West Coast feud, member André 3000 came up on stage followed by boos and said, ""But it's like this though, I'm tired of them closed minded folks, it's like we gotta demo tape but don't nobody want to hear it. But it's like this: the South got something to say, that's all I got to say."" As stated by rapper T.I., ""Outkast, period. Outkast. That's when it changed. That was the first time when people began to take Southern rap seriously.""[11] Former co-owner of the magazine The Source Benzino took credit for the incident in an interview from April 2023, saying ""they gave OutKast 4.5 mics (out of 5)... and it got back to OutKast... I didn't understand the music and I was wrong.""[12]

In 1995, another iconic group, Nappy Roots, started releasing music.  They eventually went triple platinum with hits such as Watermelon, Chicken & Gritz. Po Folks and worked with Kanye West, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and others.The most successful Southern independent labels during the mid-to-late 90s came out of the cities of Memphis and New Orleans. Both scenes borrowed heavily from a production style first introduced by way of the obscure late-1980s New York rap group The Showboys, heavily sampling the beats from their song ""Drag Rap (Trigger Man)"".[13] By the early 2000s, these scenes found mainstream success through Disturbing tha Peace in Atlanta, Cash Money Records and No Limit Records out of New Orleans, and Hypnotize Minds out of Memphis, revolutionizing financial structures and strategies for independent Southern rap labels. According to HipHopDX, ""Not only is the South on the radar, but now the region that was an underdog is the barometer for rap music and hip-hop culture.""[14] 
By the early to mid-2000s, artists from all over the South had begun to develop mainstream popularity with artists like Slim Thug, Paul Wall, Mike Jones, and Lil Keke from Houston; T.I., Ludacris, Bubba Sparxxx, Lil Jon, Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy from Atlanta; Trick Daddy and Rick Ross from Miami; Master P, B.G., Lil Wayne and Juvenile from New Orleans, and Three 6 Mafia and Yo Gotti from Memphis all becoming major label stars during this time.[15][16]

Southern hip hop peaked in popularity from 2002 through 2004. In 2002, Southern hip hop artists accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the singles on hip hop music charts. On the week of December 13, 2003, Southern urban artists, labels and producers accounted for six of the top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100: OutKast (with two singles), Ludacris, Kelis (produced by The Neptunes), Beyoncé and Chingy (on Ludacris' Disturbing Tha Peace label). Additionally, from October 2003 through December 2004, the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart was held by a Southern urban artist for 58 out of 62 weeks. This was capped by the week of December 11, 2004 when seven out of the top ten songs on the chart were held by or featured Southern urban artists. In 2004, Vibe magazine reported that Southern artists accounted for 43.6% of the airplay on urban radio stations (compared to 29.7% for the Midwest, 24.1% for the East Coast and 2.5% for the West coast).[17]

""The Dirty Decade"", spanning from 1997 to 2007, marks a period in the evolution of southern hip-hop. This era witnessed the genre's maturation and widespread recognition, with artists from the Southern United States achieving commercial success. The term ""Dirty Decade"" is often used to describe the gritty and distinct sound that emerged during this period. Southern hip hop has its roots in the 1980s, with artists like OutKast and the Geto Boys laying the foundation for the genre.[18] It was during the Dirty Decade that Southern hip-hop gained prominence on a national scale. The genre's influences are diverse, drawing from regional cultural elements and blending them with traditional hip-hop elements. Artists who rose to prominence during this era, such as OutKast, Ludacris, and Lil Wayne, continued to shape the contemporary hip-hop landscape.[18] The regional diversity showcased during the Dirty Decade laid the groundwork for the ongoing growth and expansion of Southern hip-hop.

The Dirty Decade in Southern hip-hop was characterized by specific musical elements that set it apart from other regional styles. Heavy basslines, distinctive use of slang, and a fusion of regional influences into the production were notable features. Producers such as Mannie Fresh, Lil Jon, and Organized Noize played key roles in shaping the sound of this era. Artists from the region consistently dominated the charts, with many albums reaching platinum and gold status. Crunk music, in particular, gained widespread popularity, with hits like ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz and ""Salt Shaker"" by the Ying Yang Twins becoming notable contributions to the genre.[18]

In the late 1990s ""bounce"" music was born in New Orleans. Master P established No Limit Records. In 1992, Cash Money Records was founded, releasing bounce and gangsta rap music.

It has fast beats, catchy call-and-response lyrics, and background adlibs, all meant to make people dance and express themselves. Since the late 1980s, bounce music has been really popular in New Orleans. One of the most famous bounce artists is Big Freedia, known as the Queen of Bounce. She has worked with Beyonce, walked the MET Gala Runway with Ciara, and even had her own TV show on Fuse.

You can hear bounce music in many clubs across the city, especially at The Hangover Bar. On Second Line Sundays, brass bands play lively beats for people to dance along the parade route. If you want to learn some moves, there are interactive twerk classes like Twerk NOLA and Shake Ya Brass at Crescent Park that feature bounce music.

More popular bounce artists are DJ Jubilee, Juvenile, Magnolia Shorty.[19]

Miami Bass music is known for its explicit lyrics about sex, fast dance beats, and a strong bass with a constant kick drum. The genre is all about parties, drugs, sex, and champagne.[20]

The single ""Throw The D"" by the group 2 Live Crew in January 1986 was the first Miami bass song. Fresh Kid Ice (Christopher Wong Won) said that the song came about when he noticed a new popular dance in Miami, when Herman Kelly and Life's song ""Dance to the drummer's beat"" played.[21] 2 Live Crew released their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be in 1989.[22]

2 Live Crew got into trouble for explicit lyrics in their 1989 album ""As Nasty as They Wanna Be."" A judge said it was too obscene to sell, but 2 Live Crew won the legal fight. This allowed them and others to keep using slang and explicit content, but they had to put a warning on album covers.

Luke Campbell and David Hobbs from 2 Live Crew were important in making Miami Bass popular through these controversial albums.[20]

Three 6 Mafia, DJ Paul, Juicy J, Lord Infamous, Koopsta Knicca, Crunchy Black, Gangsta Boo, La Chat, Project Pat, Indo G, Playa Fly, Eightball and MJG, Yo Gotti, Moneybagg Yo, NLE Choppa, Pooh Shiesty, Blac Youngsta, Young Dolph and Mental Ward Click all came from Memphis, Tennessee.[23][24]

Tennessee hip-hop blends the style of southern rap, and funk. The Tennessee rap scene popularized musical subgenres within the community, such as Memphis Rap, and Memphis horror-core. Arrested Development's debut album 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of... had the song Tennessee in 1992, which is thought to have been the first rap song to release from the state.

The gangsta rap group Dirty is from Montgomery, Alabama.[25] As hip-hop formulated in The Bronx, its influence began to bleed to other parts of the world. For decades, hip hop has existed in Alabama. Codie G was the manager to G-side and became a mentor to many Alabamian people in the rap community. His involvement spear-headed the genre into popularity within the state of Alabama. In 1999, The group Dirty Boyz debuted with the album Country Versatile thus solidifying hip-hop's place in the state.

In 2009, the New York Times called Atlanta ""hip-hop's center of gravity"",[26] and the city is home to many famous hip-hop, R&B and neo soul musicians.[27]

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Atlanta's hip hop scene was characterized by a local variant of Miami bass, with stars like Kilo Ali and DJ Smurf (later Mr. Collipark).[26][28]

By the mid-1990s, the rise of OutKast, Goodie Mob[29] and the production collective Organized Noize, let to the development of the Dirty South style of hip-hop and of Atlanta gaining a reputation for ""soul-minded hip-hop eccentrics"", contrasting with other regional styles. On August 3, 1995, Outkast received the award for Best New Artist in New York City at the Source Awards. At the time, the primary hip hop heard nationally was from artists on the East and West Coasts, due at least partly to high- profile disputes between rappers from each coast. It was groups such as Outkast who were determined to let the world know that the South had something to say.[26]

In 2009, it was noted that after 2000/2001, Atlanta moved ""from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South"", primarily due to the massive popularity of Waka Flocka Flame's 2009 debut mixtape. Producer Drumma Boy called Atlanta ""the melting pot of the South"". Producer Fatboi called the Roland TR-808 (""808"") synthesizer ""central"" to Atlanta music's versatility, used for snap, crunk, trap, and pop rap styles.[26] The same article named Drumma Boy, Fatboi, Shawty Redd, Lex Luger and Zaytoven the five ""hottest producers driving the city"".[26]

In the late 1980s, the Geto Boys were Houston's first hip hop group to gain mainstream popularity. In the early 1990s, Texas groups such as Nemesis, PKO, and UGK (from Dallas, San Antonio, and Port Arthur respectively) also gained popularity. Before the early 1990s, most Southern hip hop was upbeat and fast, like Miami bass and crunk. In Texas, however, the music started to become slower. In the early 1990s, DJ Screw created ""chopped and screwed"" music. Although people associated with Screw have indicated any time between 1987 and 1991, Screw said he started slowing music down in 1990. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, DJ Dinero and DJ Z-Nasty helped popularize chopped and screwed music in the Mid South.[30][31]

Between 1991 and 1992, there was increased abuse of purple drank in South East Texas. Purple drank was a major influence in chopped and screwed music due to its effect of slowing down perception. DJ Screw, a known user of purple drank, said that it is not required to enjoy chopped and screwed music and that he came up with the style when high on marijuana.[30]

As the spread of Southern hip hop continued, its mainstream breakthrough occurred in 2000. Duo UGK made a high-profile guest appearance on Jay-Z's hit ""Big Pimpin'"" and also appeared on Three 6 Mafia's hit ""Sippin' on Some Syrup"". Both of these collaborations greatly increased their reputation and helped fuel anticipation for their next project. UGK's Pimp C died from a sudden heart attack after overdosing on purple drank on December 4, 2007 at the age of 33. A song that originally appeared on the compilation album The Day Hell Broke Loose 2, Mike Jones' ""Still Tippin'"", achieved mainstream success in 2004 leading to local Houston rap label Swishahouse signing a national distribution deal with Asylum Records. Jones released his major label debut, Who Is Mike Jones?, on Swishahouse/Warner Bros. in April 2005 and was certified platinum that June.[32]Paul Wall's major label debut, The Peoples Champ, on Swishahouse/Atlantic, was released in September 2005, eventually topping the Billboard 200.[33] Many rappers from Houston began to have mainstream success in the 2000s.  In 2005, MTV named Houston the new rap capital of the South.[34]

Around the same time, Ski Beatz (of Greensboro) produced ""Dead Presidents"" on Jay-Z's album ""Reasonable Doubt"", which was released in 1996. Also, 9th Wonder (of Winston-Salem) joined a group named Little Brother with fellow members Big Pooh and Phonte (of Durham).(9th Wonder left Little Brother in 2007 to solo produce, becoming one of the top 10 most successful hip hop producers of all time).

North Carolina did not hit the mainstream hip hop map until 2001 with Petey Pablo's ""Raise Up"". This song was wildly successful and helped shine a much-needed national spotlight on North Carolina's burgeoning rap industry, along with some of its biggest names and some longtime rappers from the state: Rapsody, King Mez, Kooley High, Ignite Mindz, Drique London, SkyBlew, Azon Blaze, Donovan McCray, Lazarus, Thee Tom Hardy, Troop 41, Bryce Snow, Lute, Deniro Farrar, Justus League, Edgar Allen Floe, L.E.G.A.C.Y., Kaze, Banknote Mitch, Khrysis, Keaton, Wells, Tucson, Ghost Dog, & many more.[35]

North Carolina really reached full acceptance into hip hop's heights with the rise of J Cole and his Dreamville Records (Fayetteville) in the early 2010s, which still see successful Dreamville Music Festivals being organized and thrown annually in 2021.

Another noteworthy rap artist from North Carolina is DaBaby, hailing from Charlotte, though he was born in Cleveland. Although sometimes drawing attention from self-created controversies, his lyrical skills, mixed with his exposure and unique voice, have made him a  reckonable force in hip-hop.

Among the four coasts, Southern hip-hop is one of the more recent genres compared to the other three coasts, meaning that the slang used in southern hip-hop is more recent than the slang in other coasts. A lot of the iconic southern slang that was used in hip-hop and rap came from four specific sections of the south: Houston, Memphis, Atlanta, and New Orleans. Of the many slang used in southern hip-hop, the ones that are still being used today are:

Lean, a term used widely in southern hip-hop, is a sprite-codeine-candy mixture that is used like alcohol. The drink originated from Houston in the 1960's, though back in the 60's the word ""lean"" wasn't used and the drink had multiple names for it like ""sizzurp"" or ""purple drink"". It wasn't until the 1980's-90's that the drink was referred to as lean. The song that popularized the slang term ""lean"" was called ""Sippin' Codeine"" by DJ Screw and Big Moe, released in 1996 and has the lyric ""It makes a southside playa lean"" referring to how the sprite-codeine-candy mixture makes you ""lean"". The slang is still being used today, some of the most notable examples being ""Gucci Gang"" by Lil Pump, ""Look At Me!"" by XXXtentacion, and ""I"" by Kendrick Lamar, all of these songs being relatively recent.[36][37]

Trap House, another widely used slang term in southern hip-hop, is a house where various illegal drugs are made, bought, sold, or used. The primary drugs that are common in trap houses are heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl. The reason why these drug houses are called trap houses is because the consumer of the drug feel ""trapped"" in the addiction of the drug, hence the name trap house. The slang term trap house originated in Atlanta from the 1980's when drug addiction was at a rise as an escape from the poor conditions of the neighborhoods and cities. ""Trap House"" itself is a music genre, though usually just referred to as ""trap"" in the present day, and the music genre has lyrics that show off the hard life and struggle of being a drug dealer, trying to sell drugs, and living in a poor inner city. One of the most recent example of Trap House being used in a song is by YoungBoy Never Broke Again in his song ""Trap House"" that released in 2018.[38][39]

The term Flossin' derives from the word floss,[citation needed] and means to show off expensive articles of clothing, or items. The term was birthed in Houston around 1990, originally meaning to have money, but the term developed over time into what we know it as today. It was popularized through Southern Rap, being used in songs such as Lil' Flip's Texas Boyz (Screwed) 2002, being used in the following lyrics, ""What you know about acting bad, flossin’ prowlers? I got seven DVDs, I’m watchin’ Austin Powers"".

The adjective Ratchet means to be crazy, or off the hook. Ever since the late 1990's, rappers from Shreveport, Louisiana have used the term in their songs. It derives off the Louisianan dialect for Wretched, and is used in songs like, Rapper Lil Boosie's 2005 ""Do Da Ratchet"", Nicki Minaj's 2012 ""Right By My Side"", and Juicy J's ""Bandz a Make Her Dance"".

The phrase ""Dirty South"" was introduced via the 1995 Goodie Mob track ""Dirty South"" with the chorus repeating the lyrics ""What you niggas know about the Dirty South?"" [40]The rough and complex lives of the more rural Southern rappers who routinely dealt with the racism and oppression of the areas they lived in compared to the urban and more polished lives of Northerners made the contrast between the two sides even more apparent, forcing the Southern artists to have to prove themselves more to gain respect in the industry. The emergence of the Dirty South as a force in the music industry led to a diverse explosion of different genres and styles not yet explored in hip-hop. The complexity and ruggedness of the South as well as the underestimation of its talents by its peers led to its advancement and growth as a whole.[citation needed]

There was an American duo named Kriss Kross. Their names are Chris “Daddy Mac” Smith and Chris “Mac Daddy” Kelly. They are from Atlanta Georgia. Kriss Kross was the youngest hip-hop pair to ever gain such a following. At the ripe age of 12 and 13 years old Kriss Kross made a fashion choice that was not done before in the hip-hip industry. The duo wore their clothes backwards, while performing on stage. This became a trend in the 90s, this fashion choice helped the youthful duo rise to fame.[41]

Migos were an American hip hop trio, stage names are Takeoff, Offset, and Quavo. They are from Atlanta, Georgia. Migos take a lot of pride representing the south. The Migos were the “founders” of drip. They were rappers that used high in fashion. They popularized high in brands in the black community. The Migos have walked the MET Gala carpets. Migos hit mainstream hip-hop with their hit song Versace and their signature sound. Drake then cosigned the group with verse on the remix, that became on the Billboard charts. Not only did a song that introduced the Migos to the world, but the tune also popularized the Versace fashion brand in hip-hop in the Black community.[42]

Travis Scott (Jacques Bermon Webster ll) is an American Rapper and record producer. Scott is from Houston, Texas. Travis worked with numerous brands, including Dover Street Market, McDonalds, PlayStation, Epic Games, and Byredo. He started his career working as an artist who made sneakers for Nike. He eventually became “a creative consultant” for they company. Christian Dior announced its partnership with Travis Scott as a musical artist for its Spring/Summer ’22 line at Paris Fashion Week, Scott appeared on stage together to introduce there further plans.[43]

Jermaine Lamarr Cole is an American rapper and record producer, from North Carolina. J Cole opened his 4 Your Eyez Only tour by wading through a sea of fans in a full orange prison jumpsuit, printed on the back was “Property of”. They look would end up being a centerpiece of the tour that added a new layer of storytelling in Cole’s performance.[44]

The term crunk is mainly used to denote a musical style that was originated by Three Six Mafia in Memphis, Tennessee, in the mid-to-late 1990s. It was popularized by Atlanta rapper Lil Jon,[45] and gained mainstream popularity in the period 2003–04.[46] A typical crunk track uses a drum machine rhythm, heavy bassline, and shouting vocals, often in call and response manner.[46]"
"Turntablism","

Turntablism is the art of manipulating sounds and creating new music, sound effects, mixes and other creative sounds and beats, typically by using two or more turntables and a cross fader-equipped DJ mixer.[1] The mixer is plugged into a PA system (for live events) and/or broadcasting equipment (if the DJ is performing on radio, TV or Internet radio) so that a wider audience can hear the turntablist's music. Turntablists typically manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic ""scratching"" effect which is a key part of hip hop music),[2] all while using a DJ mixer's crossfader control and the mixer's gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. Turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on different records (Greasley & Prior, 2013).

Turntablists, who are often called DJs (or ""deejays""), generally prefer direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by ""scratching"" and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. The word turntablist is claimed to be originated by Luis ""DJ Disk"" Quintanilla (Primus, Herbie Hancock, Invisibl Skratch Piklz).[3] After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by DJ Babu[4] to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop DJing in the 1990s.

According to most DJ historians, it has been documented that ""DJ Babu"" of the ""Beat Junkies"" / ""Dilated Peoples"" was the one who originally coined the term ""turntablist"". In 1995 while working on the groundbreaking mixtape ""Comprehension"", DJ Babu hand wrote the name ""Babu The Turntablist"" on hundreds of copies of this mixtape to describe his style of DJing, while working on the track ""Turntablism"" with ""D-Styles"" and DJ Melo-D, Babu would say ""if someone plays the piano, we call them a pianist, if someone plays the guitar, we call them a guitarist, why don't we call ourselves Turntablists?"" found in the documentary ""Scratch (2001 film)"" which was released in 2001.

John Oswald described the art: ""A phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which are unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical instrument.""[5] Some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and improvising with other performers. Depending on the records and tracks selected by the DJ and their turntablist style (e.g., hip hop music), a turntablist can create rhythmic accompaniment, percussion breaks, basslines or beat loops, atmospheric ""pads"", ""stabs"" of sudden chords or interwoven melodic lines.

The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.

The use of the turntable as a musical instrument has its roots dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when musique concrète composers did experiments with audio equipment. Experimental composers (such as John Cage, Halim El-Dabh, and Pierre Schaeffer) used them to sample and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage's Imaginary Landscape No. 1 (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and cymbal. Edgard Varèse experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s–2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as Christian Marclay, Janek Schaefer, Otomo Yoshihide, Philip Jeck, and Maria Chavez. Turntablism as it is known today, however, did not surface until the advent of hip hop in the 1970s.

Examples of turntable effects can also be found on popular records produced in the 1960s and 1970s. This was most prominent in Jamaican dub music of the 1960s,[6] among deejays in the Jamaican sound system culture. Dub music introduced the techniques of mixing and scratching vinyl,[7] which Jamaican immigrants introduced to American hip hop culture in the early 1970s.[8] Beyond dub music, Creedence Clearwater Revival's 1968 self-titled debut album features a backspin effect in the song ""Walk on the Water"".

Turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage,[9] as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.[10] The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic),[11] based in Osaka, Japan.[9] It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.[12] In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10,[12] the first direct-drive turntable on the market,[13] and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.[12] In 1971, Matsushita released the Technics SL-1100. Due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity, it was adopted by early hip hop artists.[12]

A forefather of turntablism was DJ Kool Herc, an immigrant from Jamaica to New York City.[13] He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican dub music,[8] while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the Technics SL-1100, which he used for the first sound system he set up after emigrating to New York.[13] The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the b-dancers' favorite section,[8] switching back and forth between the two to loop the breaks to a rhythmic beat.[13]

The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200,[14] which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.[9] It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.[14] Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.[12][14]

Turntablism as a modern art form and musical practice has its roots within African-American inner city hip-hop of the late 1970s. Kool Herc (a Jamaican DJ who immigrated to New York City), Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash are widely credited for having cemented the now established role of DJ as hip hop's foremost instrumentalist.[15] Kool Herc's invention of break-beat DJing is generally regarded as the foundational development in hip hop history, as it gave rise to all other elements of the genre. His influence on the concept of ""DJ as turntablist"" is equally profound.

To understand the significance of this achievement, it is important to first define the ""break"". Briefly, the ""break"" of a song is a musical fragment only seconds in length, which typically takes the form of an ""interlude"" in which all or most of the music stops except for the percussion. Kool Herc introduced the break-beat technique as a way of extending the break indefinitely. This is done by buying two of the same record, finding the break on each record, and switching from one to the other using the DJ mixer: e.g., as record A plays, the DJ quickly backtracks to the same break on record B, which will again take the place of A at a specific moment where the audience will not notice that the DJ has switched records. Using that idea, Grandmaster Flash elaborated on Kool Herc's invention of break-beat DJing and came up with the quick-mix theory, in which Flash sectioned off a part of the record like a clock.[16] He described it as being ""...like cutting, the backspin, and the double-back.""[16]

Kool Herc's revolutionary techniques set the course for the development of turntablism as an art form in significant ways. Most important, however, he developed a new form of DJing that did not consist of just playing and mixing records one after the other. The type of DJ that specializes in mixing a set is well respected for his/her own set of unique skills, but playlist mixing is still DJing in the traditional sense. Kool Herc instead originated the idea of creating a sequence for his own purposes, introducing the idea of the DJ as the ""feature"" of parties, whose performance on any given night would be different from on another night, because the music would be created by the DJ, mixing a bassline from one song with a beat from another song (Greasley & Prior, 2013). The DJ would be examined critically by the crowd on both a technical and entertainment level.

Grand Wizzard Theodore, an apprentice of Flash, who accidentally isolated the most recognizable technique of turntablism: scratching. He put his hand on a record one day, to silence the music on the turntable while his mother was calling out to him and thus accidentally discovered the sound of scratching by moving the record back and forth under the stylus. Though Theodore discovered scratching, it was Flash who helped push the early concept and showcase it to the public, in his live shows and on recordings. DJ Grand Mixer DXT is also credited with furthering the concept of scratching by practicing the rhythmic scratching of a record on one or more turntables (often two), using different velocities to alter the pitch of the note or sound on the recording (Alberts 2002). DXT appeared (as DST) on Herbie Hancock's hit song ""Rockit"".[15] These early pioneers cemented the fundamental practice that would later become the emerging turntablist art form. Scratching would during the 1980s become a staple of hip hop music, being used by producers and DJs on records and in live shows. By the end of the 1980s it was very common to hear scratching on a record, generally as part of the chorus of a track or within its production.

On stage the DJ would provide the music for the MCs to rhyme and rap to, scratching records during the performance and showcasing his or her skills alongside the verbal skills of the MC. The most well known example of this 'equation' of MCs and DJ is probably Run-D.M.C. who were composed of two MCs and one DJ. The DJ, Jam Master Jay, was an integral part of the group since his turntablism was critical to Run DMC's productions and performances. While Flash and Bambaataa were using the turntable to explore repetition, alter rhythm and create the instrumental stabs and punch phrasing that would come to characterize the sound of hip hop, Grandmaster DST was busy cutting ""real"" musicians on their own turf. His scratching on Herbie Hancock's 1983 single, ""Rockit"", makes it perhaps the most influential DJ track of them all – even more than (Grandmaster Flash's) ""Wheels of Steel"", it established the DJ as the star of the record, even if he wasn't the frontman.  Compared to ""Rockit"", West Street Mob's ""Break Dancin' – Electric Boogie"" (1983) was punk negation. As great as ""Break Dancin'"" was, though, it highlighted the limited tonal range of scratching, which was in danger of becoming a short-lived fad like human beat-boxing until the emergence of Code Money's DJ Brethren from Philadelphia in the mid-1980s.

Despite New York's continued pre-eminence in the hip-hop world, scratch DJing was modernized less than 100 miles down the road in Philadelphia, where the climate for the return of the DJ was created by inventing transformer scratching. Developed by DJ Spinbad, DJ Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff, transforming was basically clicking the fader on and off while moving a block of sound (a riff or a short verbal phrase) across the stylus. Expanding the tonal as well as rhythmic possibilities of scratching, the transformer scratch epitomized the chopped-up aesthetic of hip hop culture. Hip hop was starting to become big money and the cult of personality started to take over. Hip hop became very much at the service of the rapper and Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff were accorded maybe one track on an album – for example, DJ Jazzy Jeff's ""A Touch of Jazz"" (1987) and ""Jazzy's in the House"" (1988) and Cash Money's ""The Music Maker"" (1988). Other crucial DJ tracks from this period include Tuff Crew's DJ Too Tuff's ""Behold the Detonator""  ""Soul Food"" (both 1989)"", and Gang Starr's ""DJ Premier in Deep Concentration"" (1989).

The appearance of turntablists and the birth of turntablism was prompted by one major factor – the disappearance or downplaying of the role of the DJ in hip-hop groups, on records and in live shows at the turn of the 1990s. This disappearance has been widely documented in books and documentaries (among them Black Noise and Scratch), and was linked to the increased use of DAT tapes and other studio techniques that would ultimately push the DJ further away from the original hip-hop equation of the MC as the vocalist and the DJ as the music provider alongside the producer. This push and disappearance of the DJ meant that the practices of the DJ, such as scratching, went back underground and were cultivated and built upon by a generation of people who grew up with hip hop, DJs and scratching. By the mid-90s the disappearance of the DJ in hip hop had created a sub-culture which would come to be known as turntablism and which focused entirely on the DJ using his turntables and a mixer to manipulate sounds and create music. By pushing the practice of DJing away, hip hop created the grounds for this sub-culture to evolve (Greasley & Prior, 2013).

The origin of the terms turntablist and turntablism are widely contested and argued about, but over the years some facts have been established by various documentaries (Battlesounds, Doug Pray's Scratch), books (DJ Culture), conferences (Skratchcon 2000) and interviews in online and printed magazines. These facts are that the origins of the words most likely lay with practitioners on the US West Coast, centered on the San Francisco Bay Area. Some claim that DJ Disk, a member of the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, was the first to coin the term, others claim that ""DJ Babu"", a member of the ""Beat Junkies"", was responsible for coining and spreading the term turntablist after inscribing it on his mixtapes as""Babu the Turntablist"" and passing them around. Another claim credits DJ Supreme, 1991 World Supremacy Champion and DJ for Lauryn Hill. The truth most likely lies somewhere in between all these facts.

In an interview with the Spin Science online resource in 2005, ""DJ Babu"" added the following comments about the birth and spread of the term:

It was around 95, I was heavily into the whole battling thing, working on the tables constantly, mastering new techniques and scratches...[I] made this mixtape called ""Comprehension"", and on there was a track called ""Turntablism"" which featured Melo-D and D-Styles. And this is part of where this whole thing about turntablist came from. This was a time where all these new techniques were coming out, like flares and stuff, and there were probably 20 people or so, in around California between Frisco and LA, who knew about these. So we worked on them, talked about it and kicked about the ideas that these techniques and new ways of scratching gave us.[citation needed]

By the mid- to late 1990s the terms ""turntablism"" and ""turntablist"" had become established and accepted to define the practice and practitioner of using turntables and a mixer to create or manipulate sounds and music. This could be done by scratching a record or manipulating the rhythms on the record either by drumming, looping or beat juggling. The decade of the 1990s is also important in shaping the turntablist art form and culture as it saw the emergence of pioneering artists (Mix Master Mike, DJ Qbert, DJ Quest, DJ Krush, A-Trak, Ricci Rucker, Mike Boo, Pumpin' Pete, Prime Cuts) and crews (Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, The Allies, X-Ecutioners), record labels (Asphodel), DJ Battles (DMC) and the evolution of scratching and other turntablism practices such as Beat Juggling which are viewable in the IDA (International DJ Association/ITF) World Finals.

More sophisticated methods of scratching were developed during that decade, with crews and individual DJs concentrating on the manipulation of the record in time with the manipulation of the cross fader on the mixer to create new rhythms and sonic artifacts with a variety of sounds. The evolution of scratching from a fairly simple sound and simple rhythmic cadences to more complicated sounds and more intricate rhythmical patterns allowed the practitioners to further evolve what could be done with scratching musically. These new ways of scratching were all given names, from flare to crab or orbit, and spread as DJs taught each other, practiced together or just showed off their new techniques to other DJs. Alongside the evolution of scratching, other practices such as drumming (or scratch drumming) and beat juggling were also evolved significantly during the 1990s.

Beat juggling was invented by Steve Dee, a member of the X-Men (later renamed X-Ecutioners) crew. Beat juggling essentially involves the manipulation of two identical or different drum patterns on two different turntables via the mixer to create a new pattern. A simple example would be to use two copies of the same drum pattern to evolve the pattern by doubling the snares, syncopating the drum kick, adding rhythm and variation to the existing pattern. From this concept, which Steve Dee showcased in the early 1990s at DJ battles, Beat Juggling evolved throughout the decade to the point where by the end of it, it had become an intricate technique to create entirely new ""beats"" and rhythms out of existing, pre-recorded ones (van Veen & Attias, 2012). These were now not just limited to using drum patterns, but could also consist of other sounds – the ultimate aim being to create a new rhythm out of the pre-recorded existing ones. While beat juggling is not as popular as scratching due to the more demanding rhythmical knowledge it requires, it has proved popular within DJ battles and in certain compositional situations (van Veen & Attias, 2012).

One of the earliest academic studies of turntablism (White 1996) argued for its designation as a legitimate electronic musical instrument—a manual analog sampler—and described turntable techniques such as backspinning, cutting, scratching and blending as basic tools for most hip hop DJs. White's study suggests the proficient hip-hop DJ must possess similar kinds of skills as those required by trained musicians, not limited to a sense of timing, hand–eye coordination, technical competence and musical creativity. By the year 2000, turntablism and turntablists had become widely publicized and accepted in the mainstream and within hip hop as valid artists. Through this recognition came further evolution.

This evolution took many shapes and forms: some continued to concentrate on the foundations of the art form and its original links to hip hop culture, some became producers utilizing the skills they'd learnt as turntablists and incorporating those into their productions, some concentrated more on the DJing aspect of the art form by combining turntablist skills with the trademark skills of club DJs, while others explored alternative routes in utilizing the turntable as an instrument or production tool solely for the purpose of making music – either by using solely the turntable or by incorporating it into the production process alongside tools such as drum machines, samplers, computer software, and so on.  Digital turntablism techniques later was coined into a term called controllerism, which inspired a movement of new digital DJs such as DJ Buddy Holly and Moldover.  DJ Buddy and Moldover went on to create a song called ""Controllerism"" that pays homage to the sound of digitally emulated turntablism.

New DJs, turntablists and crews owe a distinct debt[why?] to pioneer old-school DJs like Kool DJ Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, Grandmixer DST, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa, also DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Cash Money, DJ Scratch, DJ Clark Kent, and other DJs of the golden age of hip hop, who originally developed many of the concepts and techniques that evolved into modern turntablism. Within the realm of hip hop, notable modern turntablists are the cinematic[when defined as?]DJ Shadow, who influenced Diplo and RJD2, among others,[citation needed] and the experimental DJ Spooky, whose Optometry albums showed that the turntablist can perfectly fit within a jazz setting.[according to whom?]Mix Master Mike was a founding member of the influential turntablist group Invisibl Skratch Piklz (begun in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet) and later DJ for the Beastie Boys. Cut Chemist, DJ Nu-Mark, and Kid Koala are also known[by whom?] as virtuosi of the turntables.

Starting in the 1990s in the Southern United States and burgeoning in the 2000s, a meta-genre of hip hop called ""chopped and screwed"" became a significant and popular form of turntablism. Often using a greater variety of vinyl emulation software rather than normal turntables, ""chopped and screwed"" stood out from previous standards of turntablism in its slowing of the pitch and tempo (""screwing"") and syncopated beat skipping (""chopping""), among other added effects of sound manipulation.

DJ Screw of Texas, innovated the art of chopping and screwing coining the phrase ""chopped n screwed"", taking original contemporary hit records and replaying them in the ""chopped n screwed"" art form.  This gained a very large following finally paving the way for small, independent rap labels to turn a decent profit. However, it is thought by many that DJ Michael Price started slowing down vinyl recordings before the era of DJ Screw.

This form of turntablism, which is usually applied to prior studio recordings (in the form of custom mixtapes) and is not prominent as a feature of live performances, de-emphasizes the role of the rapper, singer or other vocalist by distorting the vocalist's voice along with the rest of the recording (van Veen & Attias, 2012). Arguably, this combination of distortion and audial effects against the original recording grants greater freedom of improvisation to the DJ than did the previous forms of turntablism. Via the ChopNotSlop movement, ""Chopped and screwed"" has also been applied to other genres of music such as R&B and rock music, thus transcending its roots within the hip-hop genre.[17][18]

A transform is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and repeated movement of the crossfader. The name, which has been associated with DJ Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff,[19][20] comes from its similarity to the sound made by the robots in the 1980s cartoon, The Transformers.

A tear is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from moving the record on the turntable by hand. The tear is much like a baby scratch in that one does not need the fader to perform it, but unlike a baby scratch, when the DJ pulls the record back he or she pauses his or her hand for a split second in the middle of the stroke. The result is one forward sound and two distinct backward sounds. This scratch can also be performed by doing the opposite and placing the pause on the forward stroke instead. A basic tear is usually performed with the crossfader open the entire time, but it can also be combined with other scratches such as flares for example by doing tears with the record hand and cutting the sound in and out with the fader hand.

An orbit is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is generally any scratch that incorporates both a forward and backward movement, or vice versa, of the record in sequence. The orbit was developed by DJ Disk who incorporated the flare after being shown by DJ Qbert.[citation needed] Usually when someone is referring to an orbit, they are most likely talking about flare orbits. For example, A 1 click forward flare and a 1 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 4 very quick distinct sounds) would be a 1 click orbit. A 2 click forward flare and a 2 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 6 very distinct sounds) would be a 2 click orbit, etc. Orbits can be performed once as a single orbit move, or sequenced to produce a cyclical never ending type of orbit sound.

Flare is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and quick movement of the crossfader. The flare was invented by its namesake, DJ Flare in 1987. This scratch technique is much like the ""transform"" in some ways, only instead of starting with the sound that is cutting up off, one starts with the sound on and concentrate on cutting the sound into pieces by bouncing the fader off the cut outside of the fader slot to make the sound cut out and then back in a split second.

Each time the DJ bounces the fader off the side of the fader slot it makes a distinct clicking noise. For this reason, flares are named according to clicks. A simple one click forward flare would be a forward scratch starting with the sound on as the DJ bounces/clicks the fader against the side once extremely quickly in the middle of the forward stroke creating two distinct sounds in one stroke of your record hand and ending with the fader open. In the same manner, 2 clicks, 3 clicks, and even more clicks (if a DJ is fast enough) can be performed to do different types of flares. The discovery and development of the flare scratch was instrumental in elevating this art form to the level of speed and technical scratching that is seen in the 2010s.

A ""chirp"" is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made with a mix of moving the record and incorporating movement with the crossfade mixer. It was invented by DJ Jazzy Jeff. The scratch is somewhat difficult to perform because it takes a good amount of coordination. The scratch starts out with the cross-fader open. The DJ then moves the record forward while simultaneously closing the previously opened channel ending the first sound. Then, in a reverse fashion, the DJ opens the channel while moving the record backwards creating a more controlled sounding ""baby scratch"". Done in quick succession it sounds as though a chirp sound is being produced.

A ""stab"" is quite similar to the chirp technique but requires the crossfade mixer to be ""closed"". The stab requires the user to push the record forward and back quickly and moving the crossfade mixer with a thumb pressed against it, which results in minimal sound coming out, producing a sharp ""stabbing"" noise"".

A ""crab"" is a type of scratch used by turntablists and originally developed by DJ Qbert. It is one of the most difficult scratch techniques to master. The crab is done by pushing the record forward and back while pushing the crossfader mixer open or closed through a quick succession of 4 movements with the fingers. Variations can also include 3 or 2 fingers, and generally it is recommended for beginners to start with 2 fingers and work their way to 4. It is a difficult move to master but also versatile and quite rewarding if done right.

Visual elements may be linked to turntable movement, incorporating digital media including photographs, graphic stills, film, video, and computer-generated effects into live performance. A separate video mixer is used in combination with the turntable. In 2005 the International Turntablist Federation World final introduced the 'Experimental' category to recognise visual artistry.

Like many other musical instrumentalists, turntablists compete to see who can develop the fastest, most innovative and most creative approaches to their instrument. The selection of a champion comes from the culmination of battles between turntablists. Battling involves each turntablist performing a routine (A combination of various technical scratches, beat juggles, and other elements, including body tricks) within a limited time period, after which the routine is judged by a panel of experts. The winner is selected based upon score. These organized competitions evolved from actual old school ""battles"" where DJs challenged each other at parties, and the ""judge"" was usually the audience, who would indicate their collective will by cheering louder for the DJ they thought performed better. The DMC World DJ Championships has been hosted since 1985. There are separate competitions for solo DJs and DJ teams, the title of World Champion being bestowed on the winners of each. They also maintain a turntablism hall of fame.[21]

In Western popular music, women musicians have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, with top examples being Madonna, Celine Dion and Rihanna. However, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. In a 2013 Sound on Sound article Rosina Ncube attested that few women work in the record production and sound engineering industry.[22] Ncube claimed that ""[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male""[22] and that female producers are less well-known than their male counterparts despite accomplishing great feats within the music industry.[22] The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male.[citation needed]

In hip hop music, the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. In 2007, University of North Carolina music professor Mark Katz's article stated that it is rare for women to compete in turntable battles and that this gender disparity has become a topic of conversation among the hip-hop DJ community.[23] In 2010, Rebekah Farrugia stated that in the EDM sphere, a male-centric culture has contributed to the marginalisation of women who seek to engage and contribute.[24] Whilst turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests that the broad use, or lack of use, of the turntable by women across genres and disciplines is impacted by ""male technophilia"".[23] Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on female engagement with engineering technology.[25] Oldenziel argues that socialization is a central factor in the lack of female engagement with technology, insisting that the historical socialisation of boys as technophiles has contributed to the prevalence of men who enage with technology.[25]

Lucy Green, professor of music at the University College London, focused on gender in relation to musical performers and creators, and specifically on educational frameworks as they relate to both.[26][page needed] She suggests that women's alienation from fields with strong technical aspects such as DJing, sound engineering and music producing should not only be attributed to a feminine dislike towards these instruments.[27] Instead she argues that women entering these fields are forced to complete the difficult task of disrupting a dominant masculine sphere.[27] Despite this,[original research?] women and girls do increasingly engage in turntable and DJ practices, individually[28] and collectively,[29] and ""carve out spaces for themselves in EDM and DJ Culture"".[24] There are various projects dedicated to the promotion and support of these practices such as Female DJs London.[30] Some artists and collectives go beyond these practices to be more gender inclusive.[31][page needed] For example, Discwoman, a New York-based collective and booking agency, describe themselves as ""representing and showcasing cis women, trans women and genderqueer talent.""[32]"
"Underground hip hop","Underground hip-hop (also commonly known as indie hip-hop or underground rap) is an umbrella term for hip hop music that is outside the general commercial canon.[1] It is typically associated with independent artists, signed to independent labels or no label at all. Underground hip hop is often characterized by socially conscious, positive, or anti-commercial lyrics.[2] However, there is no unifying or universal theme – AllMusic suggests that it ""has no sonic signifiers"". ""The Underground"" also refers to the community of musicians, fans and others that support non-commercial, or independent music. Music scenes with strong ties to underground hip hop include alternative hip hop and conscious hip hop. Many artists who are considered ""underground"" today were not always so, and may have previously broken the Billboard charts.[3]

Underground hip-hop encompasses several different styles of music. Numerous acts in the book How to Rap are described as being both underground and politically or socially aware, these include – B. Dolan[4]Brother Ali,[4]Diabolic,[5]Immortal Technique,[6]Jedi Mind Tricks,[7]Micranots,[8]Mr. Lif,[5]Murs,[5]Little Brother,[3]P.O.S[9]Zion I and Madlib, among others.[10]

Underground artists with critically acclaimed albums include Atmosphere,[4]Binary Star,[7]Blu, Cannibal Ox,[3]Company Flow,[11]Del the Funky Homosapien,[12]Roc Marciano, Danny Brown, Freestyle Fellowship,[7]Hieroglyphics,[13]Juggaknots, Jurassic 5,[11]Kool Keith,[6] Little Brother,[4]MF DOOM,[14]Non Phixion,[15]Planet Asia,[16]RJD2,[6] MC TP,[17] among many others.[10]

Additionally, many underground hip hop artists have been applauded for the artistic and poetic use of their lyrics, such as Aesop Rock, Aceyalone,[7]Busdriver, Cage,[16]CunninLynguists,[18]Dessa, OhSo Kew,[19]Doomtree, El-P,[5]Eyedea & Abilities,[5]Illogic,[14]Onry Ozzborn,  MF DOOM, Rob Sonic,[12]billy woods,[20] and Sage Francis,[3] among others.

Some underground artists produce music that celebrates the fundamental elements or pillars of hip hop culture, such as Artifacts, Dilated Peoples, People Under the Stairs, and Fashawn whose music ""recalls hip-hop's golden age"".[6]

In Hip Hop's formative years, the vast majority of the genre was underground music, by definition. Although The Sugarhill Gang gained commercial success in 1979, most artists did not share such prominence until the mid-1980s. Ultramagnetic MCs debut album Critical Beatdown (1988) is seen as one of the earliest examples of ""underground hip hop"".[21] It was described that the album was characteristic of what would later be known as ""Underground Hip Hop"". New York underground rapper Kool Keith received notable success with his album Dr. Octagonecologyst, gaining more attention than any contemporary independent hip hop album ""in quite a while"".[22]The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show was a notable underground hip hop radio show that was broadcast on WKCR, and later WQHT, in New York City from 1990 until 1999.[23][24] It featured rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G., Big L, Jay-Z, and Eminem, as well as groups like Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, and Fugees, all before they gained any popularity.[25] In 1999, Prince Paul and Breeze Brewin' created one of the first rap opera albums, named A Prince Among Thieves. Rolling Stone gave the album a 4.5/5.[26]

In the late 1990s, progressive rap acts such as Black Star and Juggaknots helped inspire and shape the underground hip hop movement that would follow in subsequent decades. [27]"
"Twelve-bar blues","The twelve-bar blues (or blues changes) is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music. The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics, phrase, chord structure, and duration. In its basic form, it is predominantly based on the I, IV, and V chords of a key. Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are ""critical elements for building a jazz repertoire"".[1]

The blues originated from a combination of work songs, spirituals, and early southern country music.[2] The music was passed down through oral tradition. It was first written down by W. C. Handy, an African American composer and band leader. Its popularity led to the creation of ""race records"" and the popularity of blues singers like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey.[3] The style of music heard on race records was later called ""rhythm and blues"" (R & B). As the music became more popular, more people wanted to perform it. General patterns that existed in the blues were formalized, one of these being the 12-bar blues.[2]

The basic progression for a 12-bar blues may be represented in several ways. 
It is shown in its simplest form, without the common ""quick change"", turnarounds, or seventh chords. For variations, see the following section.

In the original form, the dominant chord continued through the tenth bar; later on, the V–IV–I–I ""shuffle blues"" pattern became standard in the third set of four bars:[6]



The common quick-change, quick to four, or quick four variation uses the subdominant or IV chord in the second bar.[7]

Seventh chords are a type of chord that includes the 7th scale degree (that is, the 7th note of the scale). There are different types of 7th chords such as major 7ths, dominant 7ths, minor 7ths, half diminished 7ths, and fully diminished 7ths.[8] These chords are similar with slight changes, but are all centered around the same key center. Dominant 7th chords are generally used throughout a blues progression. The addition of dominant 7th chords as well as the inclusion of other types of 7th chords (i.e. minor and diminished 7ths) are often used just before a change, and more changes can be added. A more complicated example might look like this, where ""7"" indicates a seventh chord:

This progression is similar to Charlie Parker's ""Now's the Time"", ""Billie's Bounce"", Sonny Rollins's ""Tenor Madness"", and many other bop tunes.[9] Peter Spitzer describes it as ""a bop soloist's cliche to arpeggiate this chord [A7♭9 (V/ii = VI7♭9)] from the 3 up to the ♭9.""[9]

There are also minor twelve-bar blues, such as John Coltrane's ""Equinox"" and ""Mr. P.C."".[10] The chord on the fifth scale degree may be major (V7) or minor (v7).[10] Major and minor can also be mixed together, a signature characteristic of the music of Charles Brown.[11]

""W. C. Handy codified this blues form to help musicians communicate chord changes.""[12] Many variations are possible. The length of sections may be varied to create eight-bar blues or sixteen-bar blues.

As the chords of a 12-bar blues follow a form, so does the melodic line. The melodic line might just be the melody of the piece or it might also include lyrics. The melody and lyrics frequently follow an AA'B form, meaning one phrase is played then repeated (perhaps with a slight alteration), then something new is played.[14] This pattern is frequently used in the blues and in musical genres that have their roots in the blues.[15]"
"Smooth jazz","Smooth jazz is a term used to describe commercially oriented crossover jazz music. Although often described as a ""genre"", it is a debatable and highly controversial subject in jazz music circles. As a radio format, however, it is clear that smooth jazz became the successor to easy listening music on radio station programming in the mid-1970s to the early 1990s.

Smooth jazz may be thought of as commercially-oriented, crossover jazz which came to prominence in the 1980s, displacing the more venturesome jazz fusion from which it emerged. It avoids the improvisational ""risk-taking"" of jazz fusion, emphasizing melodic form, and much of the music was initially ""a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B.""[1][2]

During the mid-1970s in the United States, it was known as ""smooth radio""; the genre was not termed ""smooth jazz"" until the 1980s.[3]

The term itself seems to have been birthed directly out of radio marketing efforts. In an industry focus group in the late 1980s, one participant coined the phrase ""smooth jazz"" - and it stuck.[4]

The popularity of smooth jazz as a radio format gradually declined in the early 2000s.[5]

The mid- to late-1970s included songs ""Breezin'"" as performed by another smooth jazz pioneer, guitarist George Benson in 1976, the instrumental composition ""Feels So Good"" by flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione, in 1978, ""What You Won't Do for Love"" by Bobby Caldwell along with his debut album was released the same year, jazz fusion group Spyro Gyra's instrumental ""Morning Dance"", released in 1979[3] and in 1981, a collaboration between Grover Washington Jr. and Bill Withers was released as one of the most popular smooth jazz songs ""Just the Two of Us"". Beginning with Taking Off by alto saxophonist David Sanborn, Warner Bros. Records became a viable and popular record label for smooth jazz.[citation needed]

Smooth jazz grew in popularity in the 1980s as Anita Baker, Sade, Al Jarreau, Grover Washington Jr. and Kenny G released multiple hit songs.[6]

The smooth jazz genre experienced a backlash exemplified by critical complaints about the ""bland"" sound of top-selling saxophonist Kenny G, whose popularity peaked with his 1992 album Breathless.[3]

Music reviewer George Graham argues that the ""so-called 'smooth jazz' sound of people like Kenny G has none of the fire and creativity[7] that marked the best of the fusion scene during its heyday in the 1970s"".[8]

Digby Fairweather, before the start of UK jazz station theJazz, denounced the change to a smooth jazz format on defunct radio station 102.2 Jazz FM; he stated that the owners GMG Radio were responsible for the ""attempted rape and (fortunately abortive) re-definition of the music — is one that no true jazz lover within the boundaries of the M25 will ever find it possible to forget or forgive.""[9]"
"Soul jazz","Soul jazz or funky jazz is a subgenre of jazz that incorporates strong influences from hard bop, blues, soul, gospel and rhythm and blues. Soul jazz is often characterized by organ trios featuring the Hammond organ and small combos including saxophone, brass instruments, electric guitar, bass, drums, piano, vocals and electric organ. Its origins were in the 1950s and early 1960s, with its heyday with popular audiences preceding the rise of jazz fusion in the late 1960s and 1970s. Prominent names in fusion ranged from bop pianists including Bobby Timmons and Junior Mance to a wide range of organists, saxophonists, pianists, drummers and electric guitarists including Jack McDuff, Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis, and Grant Green.[1]

Soul jazz is often associated with hard bop.[2][3][4] Mark C. Gridley, writing for the All Music Guide to Jazz, explains that soul jazz more specifically refers to music with ""an earthy, bluesy melodic concept"" and ""repetitive, dance-like rhythms.... Note that some listeners make no distinction between 'soul-jazz' and 'funky hard bop,' and many musicians don't consider 'soul-jazz' to be continuous with 'hard bop.'""[2]

According to Nick Morrison, the subgenre ""usually begins with the bass player"" who ""take[s] a strong bass line, establish[es] a steady groove between the bass and drums"", before the band can ""embellish that groove with riffs and melody lines"".[5]

Jazz pianist Horace Silver stated that ""[f]unky means earthy and blues-based. It might not be blues itself, but it does have that 'down-home' feel to it. Soul is basically the same, but there's an added dimension of feeling and spirit.""[6]

Roy Carr has described soul jazz as an outgrowth of hard bop, with the terms ""funk"" and ""soul"" appearing in a jazz context as early as the mid-1950s to describe ""gospel-informed, down-home, call-and-response blues"".[4] Carr has also noted the influence of Ray Charles' small group recordings (which included saxophonists David ""Fathead"" Newman and Hank Crawford) on Horace Silver, Art Blakey, Cannonball Adderley.[4] In his view, David Sanborn and Maceo Parker are in a line of alto saxophonists that includes Earl Bostic, Tab Smith, Adderley, and Lou Donaldson as the strongest links in the chain of the genre's evolution.[4]

In the early to mid-1950s, after he left the Count Basie Orchestra, saxophonist Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis was among the first to form a jazz group with both organ and saxophone, first with Bill Doggett and later Shirley Scott.[7] For this and his ""full bodied yet reedy tone that was equally at home in rhythm & blues settings as more modern contexts,"" he ""provided a link"" between big band swing and soul jazz.[8]

Soul jazz continued to develop in the late 1950s, reaching public awareness with the release of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco.[9][10] Cannonball Adderley noted: ""We were pressured quite heavily by Riverside Records when they discovered there was a word called 'soul'. We became, from an image point of view, soul jazz artists. They kept promoting us that way and I kept deliberately fighting it, to the extent that it became a game.""[11] Late 1950s, soul jazz artist Curtis Fuller recorded ""Five Spot after Dark"".[12]

Jimmy Smith's shift into soul jazz demonstrated the organ's potential within the genre with his albums Home Cookin' (1961) and Back at the Chicken Shack (1963). Other organists who recorded in the soul jazz genre during this period include Jack McDuff, Shirley Scott, and Charles Earland.[13] With the addition of former bebop and hard-bop musicians to the genre, the number of musicians within various facets of the style increased as soul jazz became a subgenre in its own right; and like its bop predecessor, the new genre of jazz reworked popular songs, such as ""Got My Mojo Workin',"" while saxophone and trumpet players recently converted to the genre composed hits including ""The Sidewinder"", ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" and ""Listen Here"" during the mid-1960s.[5]

An accelerating factor in soul jazz's development was the Black Power movement, which led African-American musicians to return to the African roots of their music. Tunes recorded within the genre, including ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" and ""Let My People Go"" were direct references to the civil rights and Black Power movements.[14] For instance, Adderley's music from the period has been described as containing an ""irrepressible exuberance"". Interest in the genre broadened when Adderley introduced Austrian-born keyboardist Joe Zawinul to soul jazz through his Quintet, with Zawinul contributing to its repertoire with his own compositions.[15]

Likewise Stanley Turrentine, who began recording with Jimmy Smith in 1960 and rapidly expanded his audience, lamented the lack of jazz on radio and TV, saying that more people, and particularly African Americans, would have listened to soul jazz had it received as much exposure as rock music.[16] The tenor saxophone player recorded a number of soul jazz albums throughout the 1960s, including Never Let Me Go (1963) with his wife Shirley Scott. Jazz critic Thom Jurek noted that on the recording ""the organ acts as the testifying pulpit from which to speak, and Turrentine not only speaks, he weeps and whispers and wails.""[17] Turrentine's following album, A Chip Off the Old Block (1963), marked the first shift in influence, in this case from the swing/big band era with compositions by Count Basie and Neal Hefti. Turrentine's wife again contributed in addition to hard bop trumpeter Blue Mitchell.[18] In the mid- to late-1960s, Turrentine evolved his soul jazz style from the small-group setting traditionally associated with the subgenre to an ensemble format,[19] with Joyride (1965) arranged by fellow jazz saxophonist Oliver Nelson.[20]

While Turrentine developed the core of the ""soul"" in soul jazz, Latin and funky influences developed soul jazz upon the foundation of bop. Pianist Herbie Hancock, for instance, was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of music theory and chord progressions during the 1960s.[21] Hancock's first album Takin' Off (1962) featured the funky ""Watermelon Man"", a composition recorded by both Hancock and Mongo Santamaria, and was notable for ""spare, funky piano riffing and tight, focused solo statements"" that enabled Hancock to ""begin pushing the boundaries of hard bop.""[22] The 1960s saw Hancock and trumpeter Lee Morgan's compositions be used in TV, with ""Maiden Voyage"" by Hancock appearing in a Fabergé commercial and Morgan's ""The Sidewinder"" in a Chrysler commercial.[23] Popularizations of jazz compositions, such as the renditions of ""Watermelon Man"" by Santamaria and Gloria Lynne, went further to make soul jazz appealing to Black audiences, particularly in the early to mid-1960s, though this shifted over the course of the decade so much that by the late 1960s, the jazz musicians themselves were producing hit records, with six Jimmy Smith/Blue Note albums reaching the top 200. However, jazz labels such as Blue Note found it difficult to compete with larger record companies for advertising opportunities.[23]

The growing popularity of soul jazz meant that, for many hard bop musicians, the shift from bop to soul jazz was not clearly defined, with Horace Silver releasing hard bop album The Jody Grind in 1966,[24] and the more soul-influenced Serenade to a Soul Sister – starring Turrentine – in 1968. The latter album was described by Steve Huey as ""one of the pianist's most infectiously cheerful, good-humored outings."" Silver wrote in the album's liner notes that he believed his music should avoid ""politics, hatred, or anger.""[25] Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley took even longer to make the shift, playing primarily within the hard bop genre until 1968, when he recorded Reach Out! with a light soul jazz feel.[26] His following album The Flip (1969) blended soul jazz and hard bop on its title track, according to Jurek.[27] Other jazz artists, such as Lee Morgan, wavered in and out of the soul jazz genre. Drawing influence from the reliably hard bop Jazz Messengers, Morgan's albums of the mid-1960s could be described as both hard bop and soul jazz. Morgan hired bop musicians for the album but recorded soul-influenced material, for instance on the album Cornbread (1965).[28]

Other soul jazz musicians had their roots almost entirely in soul and blues. Organist Jack McDuff, for example, was known for his particularly bluesy style, which enabled him to collaborate with young jazz talents including saxophonist Johnny Griffin and guitarist George Benson.[29] McDuff's band focused on ""groove-centric"" music but in the later '60s experimented with popular songs and larger ensembles, particularly on his album Tobacco Road (1967).[30] In contrast, former McDuff sideman and guitarist Pat Martino utilized an organ trio format during the late 1960s, with the live Young Guns (2014) album recorded at Club 118 in 1968 and 1969 featuring Gene Ludwig on organ and Randy Gelispie on drums.[31]

Among the best-known soul jazz recordings from the era are Lee Morgan's The Sidewinder (1963), Frank Foster's Samba Blues (1963), Nat Adderley's ""Work Song"", Horace Silver's ""Song for My Father"" (1964), Ramsey Lewis's ""The 'In' Crowd"" (a top-five hit in 1965[4]), Cannonball Adderley's ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy""[4] (1966) (also popularized further when covered as a top-40 pop song by the Buckinghams the following year), and Young Holt Unlimited ""Soulful Strut"". Les McCann and Eddie Harris's album Swiss Movement (1969) was a hit record, as was the accompanying single ""Compared to What"", with both selling millions of units.[4]

Soul jazz began to mold into jazz fusion by the late 1960s, with musicians such as Turrentine moving to the CTI fusion label in the early 1970s[19] and free jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler moving into jazz-rock during the late 1960s before his untimely death in 1970.[32] With the temporary decline of Blue Note and the rapid rise of the CTI label, soul jazz moved toward smooth jazz and popular music of the day, with the label's founder Creed Taylor remarking that his original goal of creating jazz for listening had ""backfired"" into the development of background music.[33]

Others pushed the boundaries of soul jazz to the extent it became fused with other genres. Tenor saxophonist Eddie Harris switched to the electric saxophone for his album titled The Electrifying Eddie Harris (1968).[34] His experiments in ""funk-influenced fusion, outside improvisations, bizarre electronic effects, new crossbreedings of traditional instruments, blues crooning, and even comedy,"" according to Steve Huey, ""fell outside the bounds of what critics considered legitimate, serious jazz."" He returned to bop late in his career.[35]

Although soul jazz was most popular during the mid-to-late 1960s, its musicians and musical influences remained popular past this time period.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, the genre saw increased crossover with fusion. The Jazz Crusaders, for example, evolved from soul jazz to soul music, becoming the Crusaders in the process.[4]"
"Vocal jazz","Vocal jazz or jazz singing is a genre within jazz music where the voice is used as an instrument.

Vocal jazz began in the early twentieth century. Jazz music has its roots in blues and ragtime and can also traced back to the New Orleans jazz tradition.[1] Jazz music is characterized by syncopated rhythms, improvisation, and unique tonality and pitch deviation.[1] In vocal jazz, this includes vocal improvisations called scat singing where vocalists imitate the instrumentalist's tone and rhythm.

Jazz singing originates from African-American enslaved people who sang field hollers and work songs.[2] Work songs and field hollers provided a mode of expression for enslaved people to challenge the oppressive structures of white power.[3] They allowed emotional expression, helped pass the time, and coordinated labor movements.[3] The musical elements of these songs involved a call-and-response structure and included repetitive phrasing and improvisation which are foundational elements of jazz music.[3]

Spirituals in churches, minstrels, and vaudeville also were the basis for jazz music.[2] Jazz grew into popularity in the early twentieth century, with its roots in blues.[2]

Louis Armstrong is often cited as being a large contributor to the rise in popularity of vocal jazz music, beginning in the late 1920s.[2] His 1926 recording of “Heebie Jeebies” is often cited as the first modern song to employ scatting, a vocal improvisation technique.[4]

In the 1940s, jazz evolved into the bop era. Notable singers of this period were Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, and Dinah Washington who had all previously sung with big bands and developed their solo careers. [2]

Alongside the rise of cool jazz in the 1950s singers followed the same laid-back approach of laid-back. This period gave rise to Peggy Lee, June Christy, Chris Connor, Helen Merrill, Chet Baker, Carmen McRae, Joe Williams, and Ray Charles.[2]

Vocal Jazz is characterized by vocal techniques such as pitch bending, inflections, consonant execution, and soft releases of vowels.[5] In vocal jazz, compared to classical choral pedagogy there is less legato and ornamental use of vibrato.[5] Jazz vocalists use more conversational pronunciation of words and shorter musical phrasing than in choral singing.[5]

Jazz arrangements require great flexibility and the ability to use mixed-register singing techniques. Jazz singers usually sing in keys that fall in their middle to low registers.[5] The microphone technique is a big part of vocal jazz singing, allowing vocalists to amplify their voices with certain phrases.[5]

Most jazz singers use a rhythm section (piano, bass, drums, and guitar) and sometimes vocal percussion.[6] Vocal jazz ensembles consist of multiple voices alongside instrumental accompaniment.

Vocal Jazz repertoire typically includes music from the Great American Songbook. Popular music arrangements are often made for vocal jazz ensembles.

"Art pop","Art pop (also typeset art-pop or artpop) is a loosely defined style of pop music[1] influenced by art theories[7] as well as ideas from other art mediums, such as fashion, fine art, cinema, and avant-garde literature.[3][8] The genre draws on pop art's integration of high and low culture, and emphasizes signs, style, and gesture over personal expression.[7][9] Art pop musicians may deviate from traditional pop audiences and rock music conventions,[10] instead exploring postmodern approaches and ideas such as pop's status as commercial art, notions of artifice and the self, and questions of historical authenticity.
Starting in the mid-1960s, British and American pop musicians such as Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, and the Beatles began incorporating the ideas of the pop art movement into their recordings.[1] English art pop musicians drew from their art school studies,[8] while in America the style drew on the influence of pop artist Andy Warhol and the affiliated band the Velvet Underground.[11] The style would experience its golden age in the 1970s among glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Roxy Music, who embraced theatricality and throwaway pop culture.[4]
Art pop's tradition continued in the late 1970s and 1980s through styles such as post-punk and synthpop as well as the British New Romantic scene,[5][10] developing further with artists who rejected conventional rock instrumentation and structure in favor of dance styles and the synthesizer.[10] The 2010s saw new art pop trends develop, such as hip hop artists drawing on visual art and vaporwave artists exploring the sensibilities of contemporary capitalism and the Internet."
"Baroque pop","Baroque pop (sometimes called baroque rock) is a fusion genre that combines rock music with particular elements of classical music.[1][4][5] It emerged in the mid-1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound[4] and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures.[3] Harpsichords figure prominently,[6] while oboes, French horns, and string quartets are also common.[5]
Although harpsichords had been deployed for a number of pop hits since the 1940s, some record producers in the 1960s increasingly placed the instrument in the foreground of their arrangements.[6] Inspired partly by the Beatles' song In My Life (1965), various groups were incorporating baroque and classical instrumentation by early 1966.[7] The term baroque rock was coined in promotional material for the Left Banke, who used harpsichords and violins in their arrangements[8] and whose 1966 song Walk Away Renée exemplified the style.[6][9]
Baroque pop's mainstream popularity faded by the 1970s, partially because punk rock, disco and hard rock took over; nonetheless, music was still produced within the genre's tradition.[9] Philadelphia soul in the 1970s and chamber pop in the 1990s both reflected the spirit of baroque pop,[4] while the latter incorporated much of the period's low fidelity musical aesthetic.[10]"
"Lo-fi music","

Lo-fi (also typeset as lofi or low-fi; short for low fidelity) is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections in the context of a recording or performance are present, sometimes as a deliberate choice. The standards of sound quality (fidelity) and music production have evolved over the decades, meaning that some older examples of lo-fi may not have been originally recognized as such. Lo-fi began to be recognized as a style of popular music in the 1990s, when it became alternately referred to as DIY music (from ""do it yourself"").[1] Some subsets of lo-fi music have become popular for their perceived nostalgic and/or relaxing qualities, which originate from the imperfections that define the genre.

Harmonic distortion and ""analog warmth"" are sometimes confused as core features of lo-fi music.[2] Traditionally, lo-fi has been characterized by the inclusion of elements normally viewed as undesirable in professional contexts, such as misplayed notes, environmental interference, or phonographic imperfections (degraded audio signals, tape hiss, and so on). Pioneering, influential, or otherwise significant artists include the Beach Boys (Smiley Smile and Wild Honey), R. Stevie Moore (often called ""the godfather of home recording""), Paul McCartney (McCartney), Todd Rundgren, Peter Ivers, Jandek, Daniel Johnston, Guided by Voices, Sebadoh, Beck, Pavement, and Ariel Pink.

Although ""lo-fi"" has been in the cultural lexicon for approximately as long as ""high fidelity"", WFMU disc jockey William Berger is usually credited with popularizing the term in 1986. At various points since the 1980s, ""lo-fi"" has been connected with cassette culture, the DIY ethos of punk, primitivism, outsider music, authenticity, slacker/Generation X stereotypes, and cultural nostalgia. The notion of ""bedroom"" musicians expanded following the rise of modern digital audio workstations, leading to the invention of the nearly synonymous term bedroom pop. In the late 2000s, lo-fi aesthetics served as the basis of the chillwave and hypnagogic pop music genres.[3]

At its most crudely sketched, lo-fi was primitivist and realist in the 1980s, postmodern in the 1990s, and archaicist in the 2000s.

—Adam Harper,  Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse (2014)[7]

Lo-fi is the opposite of High fidelity.
Music educator R. Murray Schafer, in the glossary for his 1977 book The Tuning of the World, defined the term as ""unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.""[8]

There was virtually no appreciation for the imperfections of lo-fi music among critics until the 1980s, during which there was an emergent romanticism for home-recording and ""do-it-yourself"" (DIY) qualities.[4] Afterward, ""DIY"" was often used interchangeably with ""lo-fi"".[5]  By the end of the 1980s, qualities such as ""home-recorded"", ""technically primitive"", and ""inexpensive equipment"" were commonly associated with the ""lo-fi"" label, and throughout the 1990s, such ideas became central to how ""lo-fi"" was popularly understood.[6] Consequently, in 2003, the Oxford Dictionary added a second definition for the term—""a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound"".[6]

The identity of the party or parties who popularized the use of ""lo-fi"" cannot be determined definitively.[2] It is generally suggested that the term was popularized through William Berger's weekly half-hour radio show on the New Jersey-based independent radio station WFMU, titled Low-Fi, which lasted from 1986 to 1987.[2][9] The program's contents consisted entirely of contributions solicited via mail[10] and ran during a thirty-minute prime time evening slot every Friday.[9] In the fall 1986 issue of the WFMU magazine LCD, the program was described as ""home recordings produced on inexpensive equipment. Technical primitivism coupled with brilliance.""[9]

A third definition was added to the Oxford Dictionary in 2008: ""unpolished, amateurish, or technologically unsophisticated, esp. as a deliberate aesthetic choice.""[6] In 2017, About.com's Anthony Carew argued that the term ""lo-fi"" had been commonly misused as a synonym for ""warm"" or ""punchy"" when it should be reserved for music that ""sounds like it's recorded onto a broken answering-machine"".[2]

The notion of ""bedroom musicians"" first emerged in the 21st century following the rise of laptop computers in many forms of popular or avant-garde music.[11] Since then, there had been an increasing tendency to group all home-recorded music under the umbrella of ""lo-fi"".[12] From these developments came ""bedroom pop"", a loosely-defined music genre[13] referring to artists who record at home, rather than at traditional recording spaces.[14]

""Bedroom pop"" has also been invoked to describe a distinct aesthetic.[15] Writing in 2006, Tammy LaGorce of The New York Times identified ""bedroom pop"" as ""bloglike music that tries to make the world a better place through a perfect homemade song"".[16] By the 2010s, journalists would indiscriminately apply the term to any music with a ""fuzzy"" production quality,[17]

Daniel Wray of The Guardian defined the term in 2020 as a genre of home-recorded music with a ""dreamy, introspective and intimate"" sound, and one which spans ""across indie, pop, R&B and emo"".[18] Jenessa Williams of The Forty-Five called ""bedroom pop"" almost synonymous with ""lo-fi"", having been traditionally used as ""a flattering way to dress up homespun demos and slacker aesthetics"" before being recontextualized in later years as ""midwestern emo without the thrashing; Soundcloud rap without the braggadocio.""[19]

Many of the associated artists have rejected the label.[20]

Lo-fi aesthetics are idiosyncrasies associated with the recording process. More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of audio engineering as undesirable effects, such as a degraded audio signal or fluctuations in tape speed.[21] The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.[22] Recordings deemed unprofessional or ""amateurish"" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, distortion, or room acoustics).[23] Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as ""phonographic"" and ""non-phonographic imperfections"". He defines the former as ""elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.""[24]

Recording imperfections may ""fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise"", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of ""distortion"" and ""noise"" vary and sometimes overlap.[25] The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is harmonic distortion, which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the dynamic range of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of rock and roll, and since the advent of digital recording, to give a recording a feeling of ""analogue warmth"".[26] Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (""phonographic distortion"") is typically avoided in professional contexts. ""Tape saturation"" and ""saturation distortion"" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a tape head approaches its limit of residual magnetization (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with degaussing tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.[27] Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.[28]

""Non-phonographic"" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (""coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds"") or the environment (""passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals"").[29] Harper acknowledges that the ""appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are understood to be imperfections in lo-fi.""[30] He also distinguishes between ""recording imperfections"" and ""sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or - modulation equipment...  Hypothetically, at least, lo-fi effects are created during recording and production itself, and perceptibly remain in master recordings that are then identically copied for release.""[31]

Bruce Bartlett, in his 2013 guide Practical Recording Techniques, states that ""lo-fi sounds might have a narrow frequency response (a thin, cheap sound), and might include noise such as hiss or record scratches. They could be distorted or wobbly in pitch.""[32] He offers the following methods for replicating lo-fi sounds: mixing levels so that they are unbalanced; placing obstructions between a microphone and the sound sources; placing the microphone in an unusual spot, such as in a wastebasket; recording with older, lower-quality instruments or equipment; and highlighting spill and sound reflections.[32]

DIY music predates written history, but ""lo-fi"" as it was understood after the 1990s can be traced to 1950s rock and roll.[33]AllMusic writes that the genre's recordings were made ""cheaply and quickly, often on substandard equipment. In that sense, the earliest rock & roll records, most of the garage rock of the '60s, and much of the punk rock of the late '70s could be tagged as Lo-Fi.""[34]

Released in 1967, the Beach Boys' albums Smiley Smile and Wild Honey were lo-fi albums recorded mostly in Brian Wilson's makeshift home studio; the albums were later referred to as part of Wilson's so-called Bedroom Tapes.[35] Although Smiley Smile was initially met with confusion and disappointment, appreciation for the album grew after other artists released albums that reflected a similarly flawed and stripped-down quality, including Bob Dylan's John Wesley Harding (1967) and the Beatles' White Album (1968).[36]Pitchfork writer Mark Richardson credited Smiley Smile with inventing ""the kind of lo-fi bedroom pop that would later propel Sebadoh, Animal Collective, and other characters.""[37] Editors at Rolling Stone credited Wild Honey with originating ""the idea of DIY pop"".[38]

In the early 1970s, there were a few other major recording artists who released music recorded with portable multi-tracking equipment; examples included Paul McCartney and Todd Rundgren.[39] Produced shortly after the Beatles' break-up, the home-recorded solo release McCartney was among the best-selling albums of 1970, but was critically panned.[40]  In 2005, after an interviewer suggested that it was possibly ""one of the first big lo-fi records of its day"", McCartney commented that it was ""interesting"" that younger fans were ""looking back at something like that with some kind of respect"", before adding that the album's ""sort of ... hippie simplicity ... kind of resonates at this point in time, somehow.""[41]

Something/Anything? (released in February 1972) was recorded almost entirely by Rundgren alone. The album included many of his best-known songs, as well as a spoken-word track (""Intro"") in which he teaches the listener about recording flaws for an egg hunt-type game he calls ""Sounds of the Studio"". He used the money gained from the album's success to build a personal recording studio in New York, where he recorded the less successful 1973 follow-up A Wizard, a True Star.[42] Musicologist Daniel Harrison compared the Beach Boys' late-1960s albums to Wizard, a record ""which mimics aspects of Brian's compositional style in its abrupt transitions, mixture of various pop styles, and unusual production effects. But it must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.""[43] In 2018, Pitchfork's Sam Sodsky noted that the ""fingerprints"" of Wizard remain ""evident on bedroom auteurs to this day"".[42]

Among other notable examples, writers of The Wire credit Skip Spence's Oar (1969) as ""a progenitor of both the loner/stoner and lo-fi movements"", adding that the album ""would not find a real audience for decades.""[44]Record Collector's Jamie Atkins wrote in 2018 that many lo-fi acts would be indebted to the reverb-saturated sound of the Beach Boys' 1970 song ""All I Wanna Do"".[45]Pitchfork writer Madison Brooke crowned Peter Ivers, a 1970s Los Angeles musician, as ""the weirdo king of bedroom pop, decades before the genre existed.""[46] In 2016, Billboard writer Joe Lynch described David Bowie's Hunky Dory (1971) as ""pretty much the blueprint for every lo-fi indie pop album of the last 25 years"", citing Ariel Pink as a descendant.[47] Active since 1969, Stavely Makepeace, and their spinoff group Lieutenant Pigeon, were described by AllMusic's Richie Unterberger as creating ""quirky, slightly lo-fi homemade production married to simple pop songs with heavy echoes of both '50s rock & roll and British novelty music.""[48] Michael Heatley of Record Collector describes Wizzard's debut album Wizzard Brew (1973) as ""lo-fi, retro rock'n'roll"".[49]

With the emergence of punk rock and new wave in the late 1970s, some sectors of popular music began to espouse a DIY ethos that heralded a wave of independent labels, distribution networks, fanzines and recording studios,[50] and many guitar bands were formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music instead of having to procure a record contract from a major label.[51] Lo-fi musicians and fans were predominantly white, male and middle-class, and while most of the critical discourse interested in lo-fi was based in New York or London, the musicians themselves were largely from lesser metropolitan areas of the US.[52]

Since 1968, R. Stevie Moore had been recording full-length albums on reel-to-reel tape in his parents' basement in Tennessee, but it was not until 1976's Phonography that any of his recordings were issued on a record label.[54] The album achieved some notoriety among New York's punk and new wave circles.[55] Matthew Ingram of The Wire wrote that ""Moore might not have been the first rock musician to go entirely solo, recording every part from drums to guitar ... However, he was the first to explicitly aestheticize the home recording process itself ... making him the great-grandfather of lo-fi.""[54]  Asked if he supported the ""DIY/lo-fi pioneer label"", Moore explained that his approach resulted from ""happenstance"" rather than a calculated artistic decision, although he agreed that he ""should be recognized as a pioneer"".[56] When a 2006 New York Times reporter referenced Moore as the progenitor of ""bedroom pop"", Moore responded that the notion was ""hilarious"" in light of his ""bitter struggle to make a living and get some notoriety, I scoff at it.""[57]

In 1979, Tascam introduced the Portastudio, the first portable multi-track recorder of its kind to incorporate an ""all-in-one"" approach to overdubbing, mixing, and bouncing. This technology allowed a broad range of musicians from underground circles to build fan bases through the dissemination of their cassette tapes.[58] Music critic Richie Unterberger cited Moore as ""one of the most famous"" of the ""few artists in cassetteland [that] established a reputation, if even a cult one.""[50] From 1979 until the early 1980s, Moore was a staff member on WFMU, hosting a weekly ""Bedroom Radio"" show.[54] Berger's ""Low-Fi"" program followed thereafter and effectively established lo-fi as a distinct movement associated with the spirit of punk.[2]JW Farquhar's home-recorded 1973 album The Formal Female, according to critic Ned Raggett, could also be regarded as a forerunner to ""any number of"" independent lo-fi artists, including R. Stevie Moore and the underground Texas musician Jandek.[59]

In 1980, the Welsh trio Young Marble Giants released their only album, Colossal Youth, featuring stark instrumentation, including a primitive drum machine, and a decidedly ""bedroom"" aura. Davyd Smith of the Evening Standard later wrote, ""It's hard to imagine a more lo-fi, unambitious sound.""[60] Throughout the following decade, the indie rock spheres of the American underground (bands such as college radio favorite R.E.M.[61]), along with some British post-punk bands, were the most prominent exports of lo-fi music. According to AllMusic, the stylistic variety of their music often ""fluctuated from simple pop and rock songs to free-form song structures to pure noise and arty experimentalism.""[34] Similar scenes also developed among DIY cassette-trading hip-hop and hardcore punk acts.[58] One of the most recognizable bands was Beat Happening (1984–1992) from K Records, an influential indie pop label. They were rarely known as a ""lo-fi"" group during their active years, and were only noted for their pioneering role in the movement after the term's definition evolved in the mid 1990s.[62]

Elsewhere, WFMU DJ Irwin Chusid was responsible for inventing and popularizing the ""outsider music"" category — much of it overlapping with lo-fi.[63] Adam Harper credits the outsider musicians Daniel Johnston and Jandek with ""form[ing] a bridge between 1980s primitivism and the lo-fi indie rock of the 1990s. ... both musicians introduced the notion that lo-fi was not just acceptable but the special context of some extraordinary and brilliant musicians.""[64] Hailing from New Zealand, the Tall Dwarfs' mid-1980s records are credited with anticipating the lo-fi sound.[65] AllMusic wrote that Tall Dwarfs' home-recorded releases presaged ""the rise of what was ultimately dubbed 'lo-fi' as the sound began to grow in prominence and influence over the course of the decades to follow.""[66]

During the 1990s, the media's usage of the word ""indie"" evolved from music ""produced away from the music industry's largest record labels"" to a particular style of rock or pop music viewed in the US as the ""alternative to 'alternative'"".[67] Following the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), alternative rock became a cultural talking point, and subsequently, the concept of a lo-fi movement coalesced between 1992 and 1994. Centered on artists such as Guided by Voices, Sebadoh, Beck, and Pavement, most of the writing about alternative and lo-fi aligned it with Generation X and ""slacker"" stereotypes that originated from Douglas Coupland's novel Generation X and Richard Linklater's film Slacker (both released 1991) which led to the genre being called ""slacker rock"".[68] Some of the delineation between grunge and lo-fi came with respect to the music's ""authenticity"". Even though Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was well known for being fond of Johnston, K Records, and the Shaggs, there was a faction of indie rock that viewed grunge as a sell-out genre, believing that the imperfections of lo-fi was what gave the music its authenticity.[69]

In April 1993, the term ""lo-fi"" gained mainstream currency after it was featured as a headline in The New York Times.[22] The most widely-read article was published by the same paper in August 1994 with the headline ""Lo-Fi Rockers Opt for Raw Over Slick"". In contrast to a similar story ran in the paper seven years earlier, which never deployed ""lo-fi"" in the context of an unprofessional recording, writer Matt Deihl conflated ""lo-fi"" with ""DIY"" and ""a rough sound quality"".[70] He wrote:

Alternately called lo-fi, referring to the rough sound quality resulting from such an approach, or D.I.Y., an acronym for ""do it yourself"", this tradition is distinguished by an aversion to state-of-the-art recording techniques. ... In a world of sterile, digitally recorded Top 40, lo-fi elucidates the raw seams of the artistic process.[70]

The main focus in the piece was Beck and Guided by Voices, who had recently become popular acts in the indie rock subculture.[71] Beck, whose 1994 single ""Loser"" was recorded in a kitchen and reached the Billboard top 10, ultimately became the most recognizable artist associated with the ""lo-fi"" tag.[72]  As a response to the ""lo-fi"" label, Guided by Voices bandleader Robert Pollard denied having any association to its supposed movement. He said that although the band was being ""championed as the pioneers of the lo-fi movement,"" he was not familiar with the term, and explained that ""[a] lot of people were picking up [Tascam] machines at the time ... Using a four-track became common enough that they had to find a category for it: DIY, lo-fi, whatever.""[73]

At the time, music critic Simon Reynolds interpreted the seeming-movement as a reaction against grunge music, ""and a weak one, since lo-fi is just grunge with even grungier production values.""[22] In turn, he said, lo-fi inspired its own reaction in the form of ""post-rock"".[22] A reaction against both grunge and lo-fi, according to AllMusic, was chamber pop, which drew heavily from the rich orchestrations of Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, and Lee Hazlewood.[74]

""Lo-fi"" was applied inconsistently throughout the 1990s. Writing in the book Hop on Pop (2003), Tony Grajeda said that by 1995, Rolling Stone magazine ""managed to label every other band it featured in the first half [of the year] as somehow lo-fi.""[22] One journalist in Spin credited Sebadoh's Sebadoh III (1991) with ""inventing"" lo-fi, characterizing the genre as ""the soft rock of punk"".[75][22] Additionally, virtually every journalist referenced an increasing media coverage of lo-fi music while failing to acknowledge themselves as contributors to the trend.[22]

Several books were published that helped to ""canonize"" lo-fi acts, usually by comparing them favorably to older musicians. For example, Rolling Stone's Alt-Rock-a-Rama (1995) contained a chapter titled ""The Lo-Fi Top 10"", which mentioned Hasil Adkins, the Velvet Underground, Half Japanese, Billy Childish, Beat Happening, Royal Trux, Sebadoh, Liz Phair, Guided By Voices, Daniel Johnston, Beck and Pavement.[76] Richie Unterberger's Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll: Psychedelic Unknowns, Mad Geniuses, Punk Pioneers, Lo-Fi Mavericks & More and ""the community of like-minded critics and fans surrounding him"" were especially pivotal in establishing modern notions of the lo-fi aesthetic. According to Adam Harper: ""In short, Unknown Legends bridges the interests of the [1980s] and the [Cassette Culture] Generation and those of [the 2000s], providing an early sketch, a portent – a 'leftfield blueprint', perhaps – of 00s movements like hauntology and hypnagogic pop"".[53]

The ""lo-fi"" tag also extended to acts such as the Mountain Goats,  Nothing Painted Blue, Chris Knox, Alastair Galbraith, and Lou Barlow.[2]  ""Other significant artists often aligned with 1990s lo-fi"", Harper wrote, ""such as Ween, the Grifters, Silver Jews, Liz Phair, Smog, Superchunk, Portastatic and Royal Trux have been largely omitted owing either to the comparative paucity of their reception or to its lesser relevance to lo-fi aesthetics.""[72]

From the late 1990s to 2000s, ""lo-fi"" was absorbed into regular indie discourse, where it mostly lost its connotations as an indie rock subcategory evoking ""the slacker generation"", ""looseness"", or ""self-consciousness"".[77]Pitchfork and The Wire became the leading publications on music, while blogs and smaller websites took on the role previously occupied by fanzines.[78]

The rise of modern digital audio workstations dissolved a theoretical technological division between professional and non-professional artists.[79] Many of the prominent lo-fi acts of the 1990s adapted their sound to more professional standards[77] and ""bedroom"" musicians began looking toward vintage equipment as a way to achieve an authentic lo-fi aesthetic,[80] mirroring a similar trend in the 1990s concerning the revival of 1960s space age pop and analog synthesizers.[78] R. Stevie Moore was increasingly cited by emerging lo-fi acts as a primary influence.[55] His most vocal advocate, Ariel Pink, had read Unknown Legends, and later recorded a cover version of one of the tracks included in a CD that came with the book (""Bright Lit Blue Skies"").[53] At the time of his label debut, Pink was viewed as a novelty act, as there were virtually no other contemporary indie artists with a similar retro lo-fi sound.[2]

Previous lo-fi artists generally rejected the influence of 1980s pop radio that informed most of Pink's sound.[81] Afterward, a type of music dubbed ""hypnagogic pop"" emerged among lo-fi and post-noise musicians who engaged with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. The label was invented by journalist David Keenan in an August 2009 piece for The Wire, which included Pink among his examples.[82] Pink was frequently referred to as the ""godfather"" of hypnagogic, chillwave or glo-fi as new acts that were associated with him (aesthetically, personally, geographically, or professionally) attracted notice from critics.[83] According to Pitchfork's Marc Hogan, each of those tags described what was essentially psychedelic music.[84] Adam Harper reflected in 2013 that there was a growing tendency among critics such as Simon Reynolds to overstate Pink's influence by failing to acknowledge predecessors such as R. Stevie Moore and the Cleaners from Venus' Martin Newell.[53]

In the late 2010s, a form of downtempo music tagged as ""lo-fi hip hop"" or ""chillhop"" became popular among YouTube music streamers. Several of these YouTube channels attracted millions of followers. The foundation of this style came mainly from producers such as Nujabes and J Dilla.[85]"
"Britpop","

Britpop was a mid-1990s British-based music culture movement that emphasised Britishness. Musically, Britpop produced bright, catchy alternative rock, in reaction to the darker lyrical themes and soundscapes of the US-led grunge music and the UK's own shoegaze music scene. The movement brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the larger British popular cultural movement, Cool Britannia, which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop of that decade.

Britpop was a media-driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s. Although the term was viewed as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, its associated bands typically drew from the British pop music of the 1960s, glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s and indie pop of the 1980s.

The most successful bands linked with Britpop were Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp, known as the movement's ""big four"", although Suede and Pulp distanced themselves from the term. The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993–1997, and its peak years to be 1995–1996. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis (dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"") brought the movement to the forefront of the British press in 1995. While music was the main focus, fashion, art and politics also got involved, with Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.

During the late 1990s, many Britpop acts began to falter commercially or break up, or otherwise moved towards new genres or styles. Commercially, Britpop lost out to teen pop, while artistically it segued into a post-Britpop indie movement, associated with bands such as Travis and Coldplay.

Though Britpop has been seen in retrospect as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre,[1][2][3] there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the 1960s, glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s, and indie pop of the 1980s in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur drew from the Kinks and early Pink Floyd, Oasis took inspiration from the Beatles, and Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock, notably Wire.[citation needed] and both incarnations of Adam and the Ants.[4] Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past.[5] The Kinks' Ray Davies and XTC's Andy Partridge are sometimes advanced as the ""godfathers"" or ""grandfathers"" of Britpop,[6] though Davies disputes it.[7]  Others similarly labelled include Paul Weller[8] and Adam Ant.[9]

Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the 1980s and early 1990s were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists.[10] The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music.[11] Pre-dating Britpop by four years, Liverpool-based group the La's hit single ""There She Goes"" was described by Rolling Stone as a ""founding piece of Britpop's foundation"".[12]

Local identity and regional British accents are common to Britpop groups, as well as references to British places and culture in lyrics and image.[1] Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation.[11] Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having nothing to say about their lives. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by ""youthful exuberance and desire for recognition"".[13]Damon Albarn of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an ""anti-grunge band"" he said, ""Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge.""[14]

In spite of the professed disdain for the genres, some elements of both crept into the more enduring facets of Britpop. Noel Gallagher has since championed Ride and once stated that Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was the only songwriter he had respect for in the last ten years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written ""Wonderwall"".[15] By 1996, Oasis's prominence was such that NME termed a number of Britpop bands (including The Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast) ""Noelrock"", citing Gallagher's influence on their music.[16] Journalist John Harris described these bands, and Gallagher, as sharing ""a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock's most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of 'real music'"".[17]

The imagery associated with Britpop was equally British and working class. A rise in unabashed maleness, exemplified by Loaded magazine, binge drinking and lad culture in general, would be very much part of the Britpop era. The Union Jack became a prominent symbol of the movement (as it had a generation earlier with mod bands such as the Who) and its use as a symbol of pride and nationalism contrasted deeply with the controversy that erupted just a few years before when former Smiths singer Morrissey performed draped in it.[18] The emphasis on British reference points made it difficult for the genre to achieve success in the US.[19]

John Harris has suggested that Britpop began when Blur's fourth single ""Popscene"" and Suede's ""The Drowners"" were released around the same time in the spring of 1992. He stated, ""[I]f Britpop started anywhere, it was the deluge of acclaim that greeted Suede's first records: all of them audacious, successful and very, very British.""[20] Suede were the first of the new crop of guitar-orientated bands to be embraced by the UK music media as Britain's answer to Seattle's grunge sound. Their debut album Suede became the fastest-selling debut album in the history of the UK.[21] In April 1993, Select magazine featured Suede's lead singer Brett Anderson on the cover with a Union Flag in the background and the headline ""Yanks go home!"" The issue included features on Suede, the Auteurs, Denim, Saint Etienne and Pulp and helped start the idea of an emerging movement.[22][23]

Blur were involved in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed ""The Scene That Celebrates Itself"" by Melody Maker) that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled shoegazing, while others would go on to be part of Britpop.[24] The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by the Stone Roses' inactivity.[23] Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993).

Blur's new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture's influence seeping into Britain.[23]Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Albarn) explained, ""Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.""[25] John Harris wrote in an NME article just before the release of Modern Life is Rubbish: ""[Blur's] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labelled 'yesterday's thing'.""[14] The music press also fixated on what the NME had dubbed the New Wave of New Wave, a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men.

While Modern Life Is Rubbish was a moderate success, Blur's third album, Parklife, made them arguably the most popular band in the UK in 1994.[21]Parklife continued the fiercely British nature of its predecessor, and coupled with the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in April of that year British alternative rock became the dominant rock genre in the country. That same year Oasis released their debut album Definitely Maybe, which broke Suede's record for fastest-selling debut album; it went on to be certified 7× Platinum (2.1 million sales) by the BPI.[21][26][27] Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best British Album for Parklife (ahead of Definitely Maybe).[28] In 1995, Pulp released the album Different Class which reached number one, and included the single ""Common People"". The album sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK.[29]

The term ""Britpop"" arose when the media were drawing on the success of British designers and films, the Young British Artists (sometimes termed ""Britart"") such as Damien Hirst, and on the mood of optimism with the decline of John Major's government, and the rise of the youthful Tony Blair as leader of the Labour Party.[30] After terms such as ""the New Mod"" and ""Lion Pop""[31][32] were used in the press around 1992, journalist (and now BBC Radio 6 Music DJ) Stuart Maconie used the term Britpop in 1993 (though recounting the event in a BBC Radio 2 programme from 2020, he believed it may have been used in the 1960s, around the time of the British Invasion).[33] However, journalist and musician John Robb states he had used the term in the late 1980s in Sounds magazine to refer to bands such as the La's, the Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets,[34] though many of these acts would be grouped under the Baggy, Madchester and indie-dance genres at the time.

It was not until 1994 that Britpop started to be used by the UK media in relation to contemporary music and events.[35] Bands emerged aligned with the new movement. At the start of 1995, bands including Sleeper, Supergrass and Menswear scored pop hits.[36] Elastica released their debut album Elastica that March; its first week sales surpassed the record set by Definitely Maybe the previous year.[37] The music press viewed the scene around Camden Town as a musical centre; frequented by groups like Blur, Elastica, and Menswear; Melody Maker declared ""Camden is to 1995 what Seattle was to 1992, what Manchester was to 1989, and what Mr Blobby was to 1993.""[38]

A chart battle between Blur and Oasis, dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"", brought Britpop to the forefront of the British press in 1995. The bands had initially praised each other but over the course of the year antagonisms between the two increased.[39] Spurred on by the media, they became engaged in what the NME dubbed on the cover of its 12 August issue the ""British Heavyweight Championship"" with the pending release of Blur's single ""Country House"" and Oasis' ""Roll with It"" on the same day. The battle pitted the two bands against each other, with the conflict as much about British class and regional divisions as it was about music.[40] Oasis were taken as representing the North of England, while Blur represented the South.[23] The event caught the public's imagination and gained mass media attention in national newspapers, tabloids and television news. NME wrote about the phenomenon:

Yes, in a week where news leaked that Saddam Hussein was preparing nuclear weapons, everyday folks were still getting slaughtered in Bosnia and Mike Tyson was making his comeback, tabloids and broadsheets alike went Britpop crazy.[41]

Billed as the greatest pop rivalry since the Beatles and the Rolling Stones,[42] it was spurred on by jibes thrown back and forth between the two groups, with Oasis dismissing Blur as ""Chas & Dave chimney sweep music"", while Blur referred to their opponents as the ""Oasis Quo"" in a deriding of their alleged unoriginality and inability to change.[43] In what was the best week for UK singles sales in a decade, on 20 August, Blur's ""Country House"" sold 274,000 copies against ""Roll with It"" by Oasis which sold 216,000, the songs charting at number one and number two, respectively.[44][45] Blur performed their chart topping single on the BBC's Top of the Pops, with the band's bassist Alex James wearing an 'Oasis' t-shirt.[46] However, in the long run Oasis became more commercially successful than Blur, at home and abroad.[43] In a 2019 interview, Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher reflected on the chart battle between the two songs, both of which he saw as ""shit"", and suggested that a chart race between Oasis' ""Cigarettes & Alcohol"" and Blur's ""Girls & Boys"" would have had greater merit. He also noted that he and Blur frontman Damon Albarn – with whom Gallagher had enjoyed multiple musical collaborations during the 2010s[47][48] – were now friends.[49] Both men have noted that they do not discuss their 1990s rivalry,[49][50] with Albarn adding, ""I value my friendship with Noel because he is one of the only people who went through what I did in the Nineties.""[50] Noel Gallagher has also described Blur guitarist Graham Coxon as ""one of the most talented guitarists of his generation.""[51]

In the months following the chart battle, NME states, ""Britpop became a major cultural phenomenon"".[44] Oasis's second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, sold over four million copies in the UK – becoming the fifth best-selling album in UK chart history.[52] Blur's third album in their 'Life' trilogy, The Great Escape, sold over one million copies.[53] At the 1996 Brit Awards, both albums were nominated for Best British Album (as was Pulp's Different Class), with Oasis winning the award.[54] All three bands were also nominated for Best British Group and Best Video, which were won by Oasis.[54] While accepting Best Video (for ""Wonderwall""), Oasis taunted Blur by singing the chorus of the latter's ""Parklife"" and changing the lyrics to ""shite life"".[43]

Oasis' third album Be Here Now (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite initially attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage said that while the album ""isn't the great disaster that everybody says"", he commented that ""[i]t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record"" of the period.[23] At the same time, Blur sought to distance themselves from Britpop with their self-titled fifth album,[55] assimilating American lo-fi influences such as Pavement. Albarn explained to the NME in January 1997 that ""We created a movement: as far as the lineage of British bands goes, there'll always be a place for us ... We genuinely started to see that world in a slightly different way.""[56]

As Britpop slowed, many acts began to falter and broke up.[57] The sudden popularity of the pop group the Spice Girls has been seen as having ""snatched the spirit of the age from those responsible for Britpop"".[58] While established acts struggled, attention began to turn to the likes of Radiohead and the Verve, who had been previously overlooked by the British media. These two bands – in particular Radiohead – showed considerably more esoteric influences from the 1960s and 1970s that were uncommon among earlier Britpop acts. In 1997, Radiohead and the Verve released their respective albums OK Computer and Urban Hymns, both widely acclaimed.[57]Post-Britpop bands such as Travis, Stereophonics and Coldplay, influenced by Britpop acts, particularly Oasis, with more introspective lyrics, were some of the most successful rock acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.[59]

After Britpop the media focused on bands that may have been established acts, but had been overlooked due to focus on the Britpop movement. Bands such as Radiohead and the Verve, and new acts such as Travis, Stereophonics, Feeder and particularly Coldplay, achieved wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.[62][63][64][65] These bands avoided the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.[62][66] Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included the Verve and Radiohead.[62] The music of most bands was guitar based,[67][68] often mixing elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock),[69] particularly the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Small Faces[70] with American influences. Post-Britpop bands also used elements from 1970s British rock and pop music.[68] Drawn from across the UK, the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British, English and London life, and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height.[68][71][72][73] This, beside a greater willingness to woo the American press and fans, may have helped a number of them in achieving international success.[63] They have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person, or ""boy-next-door""[67] and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative.[74]

The cultural and musical scene in Scotland, dubbed ""Cool Caledonia"" by some elements of the press,[75] produced a number of successful alternative acts, including the Supernaturals from Glasgow.[76] Travis, also from Glasgow, were one of the first major rock bands to emerge in the post-Britpop era,[62][77] and have been credited with a major role in disseminating and even creating the subgenre of post-Britpop.[78][79] From Edinburgh Idlewild, more influenced by post-grunge, produced three top 20 albums, peaking with The Remote Part (2002).[80] The first major band to break through from the post-Britpop Welsh rock scene, dubbed ""Cool Cymru"",[75] were Catatonia, whose single ""Mulder and Scully"" (1998) reached the top ten in the UK, and whose album International Velvet (1998) reached number one, but they were unable to make much impact in the US and, after personal problems, broke up at the end of the century.[65][81] Other Welsh bands included Stereophonics[82][83] and Feeder.[84][85]

These acts were followed by a number of bands who shared aspects of their music, including Snow Patrol from Northern Ireland and Elbow, Embrace, Starsailor, Doves, Electric Pyramid and Keane from England.[62][87] The most commercially successful band in the milieu were Coldplay, whose debut album Parachutes (2000) went multi-platinum and helped make them one of the most popular acts in the world by the time of their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002).[60][88] Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" (from their 2006 album Eyes Open) is the most widely played song of the 21st century on UK radio.[86] Bands like Coldplay, Starsailor and Elbow, with introspective lyrics and even tempos, began to be criticised at the beginning of the new millennium as bland and sterile[89] and the wave of garage rock or post-punk revival bands, like the Hives, the Vines, the Libertines, the Strokes, the Black Keys and the White Stripes, that sprang up in that period were welcomed by the musical press as ""the saviours of rock and roll"".[90] However, a number of the bands of this era, particularly Travis, Stereophonics and Coldplay, continued to record and enjoy commercial success into the new millennium.[60][83][91] The idea of post-Britpop has been extended to include bands originating in the new millennium, including Razorlight, Kaiser Chiefs, Arctic Monkeys and Bloc Party,[92] seen as a ""second wave"" of Britpop"".[63] These bands have been seen as looking less to music of the 1960s and more to 1970s punk and post-punk, while still being influenced by Britpop.[92]

Retrospective documentaries on the movement include The Britpop Story – a BBC programme presented by John Harris on BBC Four in August 2005 as part of Britpop Night, ten years after Blur and Oasis went head-to-head in the charts,[93][94] and Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, a 2003 documentary film written and directed by John Dower. Both documentaries include mention of Tony Blair and New Labour's efforts to align themselves with the distinctly British cultural resurgence that was underway, as well Britpop artists such as Damien Hirst.[95]

At the beginning of the decade of the 2010s, there appeared a series of new bands that combined indie rock with the Britpop of the '90s. Viva Brother were described as ""launch[ing] an update on Britpop, called Gritpop""[96][97] with their debut album, Famous First Words, although they did not receive great support from the specialised music press. Soon after in 2012, All the Young released their debut album, Welcome Home.[98]

New bands of the revival appeared some years later, including Superfood[99] and the Australian band DMA's,[100] whose debut album obtained favourable reviews from the specialised press.[101][102]

Artists of the genre have dismissed the ""Britpop"" term. Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher denied that the band were associated with the term: ""We're not Britpop, we're universal rock. The media can take the Britpop and stick it as far up the back entry of the country houses as they can take it.""[103] Blur guitarist Graham Coxon stated in the 2009 documentary Blur – No Distance Left to Run that he ""didn't like being called Britpop, or pop, or PopBrit, or however you want to put it.""[104] Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker also expressed his dislike for the term in an interview with Stephen Merchant on BBC Radio 4's Chain Reaction in 2010, describing it as a ""horrible, bitty, sharp sound.""[105]

In 2020, with attention turning to all ""landfill indie"" acts of the 2000s, Mark Beaumont of the NME argued that the term Britpop had been devalued, ignoring all the cultural aspects that had made the scene so important, with the term becoming a ""catch-all"" for ""any band that played guitars in the 1990s.""[106][107]"
"Dark culture","

Dark culture (German Schwarze Szene; Portuguese cultura obscura; Spanish escena oscura; Italian scena Dark or scena gotica), also called dark alternative scene, includes goth and dark wave culture, the dark neoclassical/dark ambient scene, parts of the post-industrial scene (with the genres electro-industrial, EBM, aggrotech and dark electro) parts of neofolk and the early gothic metal scene.[1] Dark culture's origin lies in followers of dark wave and independent music, but over the decades it has developed to a social network held together by a common concept of aesthetics, self-representation, and individualism.  The musical preferences of the dark scene are characterized by a mix of styles ranging from futurism, electropop, early music, (neo-) classical, and folk music to punk rock, rock, techno and ambient music.[2][3]

Dark culture has historically been used as an umbrella term to describe several subcultures, only emerging as its own movement in the late 1980s. Dark culture includes goth and dark wave culture, electro subculture and parts of the neofolk and post-industrial subcultures. Sometimes referred to as 'dark alternative scene', the term is rarely used in the English language, despite its significance in shaping several other movements and subcultures that emerged throughout history. In this context, the ""culture"" should not be understood as closed subculture, but as a social environment, consisting of people with similar preferences.[4] Dark culture is regarded as a community defined by common interests such as art, fashion, philosophy, and arguably most significantly, by music. Originating from the shared appreciation of dark wave and independent music, the term now collectively used as 'dark music', dark culture emerged to represent a group of people who define themselves through internal symbols and alternate forms of media. In the 21st century, the culture is appreciated as a heterogeneous collection of different subcultural currents,[5] without being tied to a particular style of music, associated thinking, behavior, or dress code, despite most members sharing similar interests of such due to its emergence from the dark scene.

The scene is not a musically or aesthetically closed and homogeneous group but rather it is composed of many different currents, some of which may be diametrically opposed in their musical or fashion ideals.  The anchor that holds all elements of dark culture together can be viewed as the color black with all its associated symbolism. It is seen as an expression of seriousness, darkness and mysticism, but also of hopelessness and emptiness, melancholy, as well as its association with mourning and death.[2][6] The dark scene is a community which defines itself through the characteristic fashions of the different currents, as well as through its media and meeting places, especially events and dance clubs.

Although the significant movement of 'dark culture' only emerged in the late 1980s, a deeper history exists that inspired this movement dating back to the 1600s during the emergence of witchcraft and witches in Early Modern Europe, as well as the influence from Victorian iconographies.[7] The origin of the term 'dark culture' initially appeared in Berlin, its use slowly emerging in more magazines and reports, finally becoming a widely-used term in the 1990s.

The term was used initially to target a specific group of magazine readers who shared similar interests in the dark scene, the magazine Zillo[8] considered the most important media platform for dark culture and was at the forefront of anchoring the term 'dark culture' into modern language. Mostly used as a generic term for all sub-scenes and trends in the black scene, nowadays the term is preferred by a large number of scene followers. By 2010, it can be said that the term had properly established itself, particularly in sociology and youth culture research. Due to its emergence in Germany, an assessment was done to conduct the size of German dark culture in 2004, resulting in an estimation of around 50,000 to 100,000 members of people,[9] this number later re-confirmed in 2010. This number has since grown and spreads internationally by the day, members of dark culture forming in many countries around the world.

The broad spectrum of dark culture has many elements that comprise the movement's general description. Music, the colour black, and fashion can be viewed as the main features of dark culture and are a few of the characteristics that allow for individual expression within the movement itself. The element of religion has been historically scrutinised as a signifier of dark culture, however many members of the scene attribute occultist ways of thinking to religious beliefs.

Dark culture is divided into different currents, some of which are in stark contrast to one another in their musical and fashion ideas.[10] The musical preferences of the different supporters of the black scene are characterized by a style mix that covers a broad spectrum from avant-garde to electronic pop music, early music, neo-classical and folk to punk rock, techno and ambient.[11] The term dark music is preferred in the social and cultural studies of music within dark culture, used as a collective term for the entirety of the music received in this scene.[4] Alternate dark waves of music includes darkcore, dark ambient, dark cabaret, dark folk, dark psytrance, and dark wave music which is part of the new wave movement.

Due to its internationally recognized events and the high proportion of music produced in Germany, the German subculture is perceived as outstanding and special. Much of dark culture's foundations can be attributed to beginning in Germany, where the movement is celebrated by many, particularly visible in the element of music. Throughout Germany, dark music is very popular and each year the country hosts a number of festivals that celebrate this musical genre. 'Wave-Gotik-Treffen' is an annual festival held in Leipzig, Germany, which honours 'dark music' and 'dark culture', attracting between 18,000 - 20,000[12] attendees each year. The event is one of the largest worldwide celebrations of the gothic, cybergoth, steampunk, and rivethead subcultures, hosting up to 200 alternate bands each year.

The colour black within dark culture can be noted as the lowest common denominator in recognizing features of this movement. Black is a central part of communication within dark culture, symbolizing and representing a vast spectrum of elements this scene represents, within emotion, fashion, music, and general behavior. Among other things, it is a visual expression of feelings surrounding hopelessness, melancholy, darkness, and is moreover most significantly used as a reference towards grief and death.

In addition to the color black, aesthetic awareness and a theme of individuality has been at the center of dark culture. These factors require a constant individual self-presentation against the background of what can be considered as 'the norm'. Thus, the main points of social demarcation are stylistic and visually aesthetic, whereby the fashion and style becomes the core content of self-expression.

Since its emergence, dark culture has differentiated a range of sub-scenes, resulting in a variation of emerging styles, all independent however in close similarity to a general 'gothic style'. The different currents of dark culture often intrinsically influenced one another throughout the gradual development of the movement.[13] While there were always dominant style elements in the different time periods in which dark culture has existed, these were often combined with other current or past styles, however all generally corresponding to a typical 'gothic style' which has existed for many years and can be dated back to styles existing during the Victorian era. Despite the deep rooting in the history of dark culture's fashion, the evolution of stylistic elements and their fluid nature means that the scene cannot be reduced to a certain appearance. A general similarity can only be determined in the dominance of the color black, the general appearance of dark culture usually corresponding to a mixed form of different stylistic elements.

The colour black and the rise of consciousness surrounding aesthetics and visual self expression have been developed through the stylistic elements that dark culture represents. Although the fashion of the movement cannot be narrowed down to one particular style, there are notable common aesthetic choices made by members of the scene. Body jewelry such as piercings and tattoos are just as common as clothing in the realm of self-expression in dark culture. Jewelry is mostly worn in silver and steel and often include animal symbols in the form of spiders, snakes and scorpions as well as religious and mythological symbols.[14] Furthermore, alternate materials that are generally seen as more 'alternate' fashion choices are enjoyed by dark culture designers such as leather, mesh and velvet. Articles of clothing that are also seen as more androgynous are common within the scene, such as men's skirts and more masculine fits of clothing worn by females to challenge societal gender norms.

Religion as an element of dark culture has been viewed by many in the scene as an abstract topic that is constantly critically questioned. The concept of death which stands as a main theme within dark culture, as well as the human emotion in dealing with mourning is considered by some members of the movement to be relative to religious content. Throughout recent years, the attention to the topic of faith has been attributed to humanity's continuation in attaining the meaning behind the concept of being, which has been seen as especially prevalent within youth. This engagement with finding a higher power of meaning in life, specifically within religion, although not directly relative, has been considered by some to be a leading element of what dark culture represents. In the scene, religious rituals and ceremonies have been explored yet are not engrained in the foundations of what dark culture was bred from. Despite this, the theoretical and practical preoccupation with occultism and esotericism has always been a permanent part of dark culture, and in some ways can be attributed to religious movements and ways of thinking.

Although the term dark culture has been used in scene media and the press since the 1990s, the misleading title Gothic, referring to a sub-flow of the scene, is wrongly used to describe elements specifically linked to dark culture.[15] Since circa 2004, term 'Gothic' has been used by non-members of the dark scene to wrongly title members of dark culture, leading to much confusion and controversy regarding all sub-cultures and sub-flows of dark culture. The Gothic subculture is specifically linked to the post-punk and wave movement within music, and thus only represents a small portion of the large spectrum of dark culture, despite Gothicism being used as an overarching term to name all members of the dark scene.[13] Due to this, the use of gothic subculture as a term has sparked controversy within dark culture, most notable in the music press industry and international use of the term, such misuse rooted in confusion and lack of knowledge of the subcultures and their differentiating elements.

Throughout history, highly significant events have evolved in the celebration and acknowledgement of movements surrounding dark culture. A significant event is World Goth Day, which originated in the United Kingdom in 2009; held on 22 May, its observance has spread internationally. Aspects of dark culture's fashion, music, and art are celebrated on this day and combine to honour the history of this movement and the inclusivity and dark expression that it represents.[16]

Events that celebrate the movement include festivals, such as Blackfield, Castle Rock, and Dark Dance which all focus exclusively on interpretations of dark culture. Other events that are not specifically attributed to the celebration of dark culture, however, feature dark music artists and bands include Amphi festival, Dark Malta festival, Secret Garden festival, and Zita rock festival.

"Europop","Europop (also spelled Euro pop) is a style of pop music that originated in Europe during the mid-to-late 1960s[2] and developed to today's form throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with revivals and moderate degrees of appreciation also in the 2000s and the 2010s. It features catchy and bouncy dance beats, accompanied by euphoric pop-influenced melodies. The lyrics are usually very simple and carefree in order to have international appeal. One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more oriented towards European dance genres, such as trance, eurodance, and eurodisco.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of ABBA (1972–1983).[4] The Swedish four-person band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored twenty top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Europop became very popular. Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Steps, Right Said Fred, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group Eiffel 65 were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group Alcazar.

In central Europe, Italo disco (also known as 1980s Euro disco) and Euro house were the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.

"Indie pop","

Indie pop (also typeset as indie-pop or indiepop) is a music genre and subculture[1] that combines guitar pop with DIY ethic[3] in opposition to the style and tone of mainstream pop music.[8] It originated from British post-punk[4] in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Compared to its counterpart, indie rock,[5] the genre is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free.[5] In later years, the definition of indie pop has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings.[4] Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop.[5]

Indie pop is not just ""indie"" that is ""pop."" Not too many people realize this, or really care either way. But you can be sure indie pop's fans know it. They have their own names for themselves ... the music they listen to ... their own canon of legendary bands ... and legendary labels ... their own pop stars ... their own zines ... websites ... mailing lists ... aesthetics ... festivals ... iconography ... fashion accessories ... and in-jokes ... in short, their own culture.

—Nitsuh Abebe, Pitchfork[1]

Within indie genres, issues of authenticity are especially prominent: indie was born in a Utopian attempt to stop the inevitable cycle of bands being co-opted - and, it is assumed, corrupted - by the mainstream.

—Emily I. Dolan, Popular Music[2]

Both indie and indie pop had originally referred to the same thing during the late 1970s, originally abbreviations for independent and popular. Inspired more by punk rock's DIY ethos than its style, guitar bands were formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music instead of having to procure a record contract from a major label.[1] According to Emily Dolan, indie is predicated on the distorted music of the Velvet Underground, the ""rebellious screaming"" of early punk, and ""some of rock's more quirky and eccentric figures"", such as Jonathan Richman.[2]Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe identifies the majority of indie as ""all about that 60s-styled guitar jangle"".[1]The Monochrome Set's[9] early singles were so heavily influential to indie pop band the Smiths that Johnny Marr stated without them, the Smiths would not have existed.[10][11]

Indie pop was an unprecedented contrast from the gritty and serious tones of previous underground rock styles, as well as being a departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music.[1] Distinguished from the angst and abrasiveness of its indie rock counterpart,[5] the majority of indie pop borrows not only the stripped-down quality of punk, but also ""the sweetness and catchiness of mainstream pop"".[2] Music critic Simon Reynolds says that indie pop defines itself against ""charting pop"".[8] Abebe explains:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}

One of those things was the idea that rock music was supposed to be cool – ""cool"" meaning sexy, tough, arty, fiery, or fantastical... The charts had ""cool"" covered – these kids, in their basements and bedrooms, were trying to hand-craft a mirror-image of it, a pop world where they were the stars... and a little bit of a raspberry blown at the larger musical world, which (sensibly) went right on preferring something more interesting than average white kids playing simple pop songs.[1]

Despite their relatively minor commercial success (their third album was sardonically titled They Could Have Been Bigger than the Beatles), the Television Personalities are highly regarded by critics and have been widely influential, especially on the C86 generation.[12] Reynolds has said that ""what we now know as indie music was invented in Scotland,""[13] with reference to the emergence of Postcard Records in 1979. However, some have posited that the concept of indie music did not crystallise until the late 1980s and early 1990s.[2] Brisbane band the Go-Betweens were an early influential indie pop band, releasing their first single ""Lee Remick"" in 1978.[14] American indie pop band Beat Happening's 1985 eponymous debut album was also influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America.[15] In the early 1990s, English indie pop influenced and branched off to a variety of styles. The US, which did not have as much of a scene in the 1980s, had many indie pop enthusiasts by the mid 1990s.[1] Most of the modern notion of indie music stems from NME's 1986 compilation C86, which collects many guitar bands who were inspired by the early psychedelic sounds of 1960s garage rock.[16]

Names that indie pop fans use for themselves are popkids and popgeeks, and for the music they listen to, p!o!p, twee, anorak and C86. Abebe says that the Scottish group the Pastels typified the ""hip end of 'anorak': Their lazy melodies, lackadaisical strum, and naive attitude transformed the idea of the rock band into something casual, intimate, and free from the pretense of cool"".[1]

Everett True, a writer for NME in the 1980s, believes that

was not the main factor behind indie pop, arguing that Sarah Records was more responsible for sticking to a particular sound, and that: ""C86 didn't actually exist as a sound, or style. ... I find it weird, bordering on surreal, that people are starting to use it as a description again"".[17] Geoff Taylor, a member of the band Age of Chance, added: ""We never considered ourselves part of any scene. I'm not sure that the public at large did either, to be honest. We were just an independent band around at that same time as the others.""[18][better source needed]

Bob Stanley, a Melody Maker journalist in the late 1980s and founding member of pop band Saint Etienne, acknowledges that participants at the time reacted against lazy labelling, but insists they shared an approach:[improper synthesis?] ""Of course the 'scene', like any scene, barely existed. Like squabbling Marxist factions, groups who had much in common built up petty rivalries. The June Brides and the Jasmine Minks were the biggest names at Alan McGee's Living Room Club and couldn't stand the sight of each other. Only when the Jesus and Mary Chain exploded and stole their two-headed crown did they realise they were basically soulmates"".[19][verification needed]Manic Street Preachers bassist Nicky Wire remembers that it was the bands' very independence that gave the scene coherence: ""People were doing everything themselves - making their own records, doing the artwork, gluing the sleeves together, releasing them and sending them out, writing fanzines because the music press lost interest really quickly.""[20]

Many of the actual C86 bands distanced themselves from the scene cultivated around them by the UK music press - in its time, C86 became a pejorative term for its associations with so-called ""shambling"" (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement.[21][verification needed]

Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop[5] that originates from C86. Characterised by its simplicity and perceived innocence, some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, most bands were distributed by Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US).[22]

Shibuya-kei is a Japanese style from the 1990s that was embraced by indie pop enthusiasts, partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Out of all the Japanese groups from the scene, Pizzicato Five was the closest to achieving mainstream success in the US.[23]

Chamber pop is a subgenre of indie pop that features lush orchestrations. Heavily influenced by Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach,[5] the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records embodied the sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that typified the style,[24] whilst the Divine Comedy were the most popular chamber pop act of the Britpop era.[25]"
"Jazz fusion","

Jazz fusion (also known as fusion,[3]jazz rock, and jazz-rock fusion) is a popular music genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined jazz harmony and improvisation with rock music, funk, and rhythm and blues. Electric guitars, amplifiers, and keyboards that were popular in rock and roll started to be used by jazz musicians, particularly those who had grown up listening to rock and roll.

Jazz fusion arrangements vary in complexity. Some employ groove-based vamps fixed to a single key or a single chord with a simple, repeated melody. Others use elaborate chord progressions, unconventional time signatures, or melodies with counter-melodies. These arrangements, whether simple or complex, typically include improvised sections that can vary in length, much like in other forms of jazz.

As with jazz, jazz fusion can employ brass and woodwind instruments such as trumpet and saxophone, but other instruments often substitute for these. A jazz fusion band is less likely to use piano and double bass, and more likely to use electric guitar, electric piano, synthesizers, and bass guitar.

The term ""jazz rock"" is sometimes used as a synonym for ""jazz fusion"" and for music performed by late 1960s- and 1970s-era rock bands that added jazz elements to their music. After a decade of popularity during the 1970s, fusion expanded its improvisatory and experimental approaches through the 1980s in parallel with the development of a radio-friendly style called smooth jazz.[4] Experimentation continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Fusion albums, even those that are made by the same group or artist, may include a variety of musical styles. Rather than being a codified musical style, fusion can be viewed as a musical tradition or approach.

When John Coltrane died in 1967, rock was the most popular music in America, and DownBeat magazine went so far as to declare in a headline that: ""Jazz as We Know It Is Dead"".[5]AllMusic states that ""until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate"".[6]

Guitarist Larry Coryell, sometimes called the godfather of fusion, referred to a generation of musicians who had grown up on rock and roll when he said, ""We loved Miles but we also loved the Rolling Stones.""[7] In 1966, he started the band the Free Spirits with Bob Moses on drums and recorded the band's first album,[5]Out of Sight and Sound, released in 1967. That same year, DownBeat began to report on rock music.[7] After the Free Spirits, Coryell was part of a quartet led by vibraphonist Gary Burton, releasing the album Duster with its rock guitar influence.[5] Burton produced the album Tomorrow Never Knows for Count's Jam Band, which included Coryell, Mike Nock, and Steve Marcus, all of them former students at Berklee College in Boston.[5]

The pioneers of fusion emphasized exploration, energy, electricity, intensity, virtuosity, and volume. Charles Lloyd played a combination of rock and jazz at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 with a quartet that included Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette.[7] Lloyd adopted the trappings of the California psychedelic rock scene by playing at the rock venue the Fillmore West, wearing colorful clothes, and giving his albums titles like Dream Weaver and Forest Flower, which were bestselling jazz albums in 1967.[5] Flautist Jeremy Steig experimented with jazz in his band Jeremy & the Satyrs with vibraphonist Mike Mainieri. The jazz label Verve released the first album (Freak Out) by rock guitarist Frank Zappa in 1966.[7]Rahsaan Roland Kirk performed with Jimi Hendrix at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London.[7]

As members of Miles Davis' band, Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock played electric piano on Filles de Kilimanjaro. Davis wrote in his autobiography that in 1968 he had been listening to Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, and Sly and the Family Stone.[7] When Davis recorded Bitches Brew in 1969, he mostly abandoned the swing beat in favor of a rock and roll backbeat and bass guitar grooves. The album ""mixed free jazz blowing by a large ensemble with electronic keyboards and guitar, plus a dense mix of percussion.""[8] Davis played his trumpet like an electric guitar—plugged in to electronic effects and pedals.

By the end of the first year, Bitches Brew sold 400,000 copies, four times the average for a Miles Davis album. Over the next two years, the aloof Davis recorded more often, worked with many sidemen, appeared on television, and performed at rock venues. Just as quickly, Davis tested the loyalty of rock fans by continuing to experiment. His producer, Teo Macero, inserted previously recorded material into the Jack Johnson soundtrack, Live-Evil, and On the Corner.[9]

Although Bitches Brew gave him a gold record, the use of electric instruments and rock beats created consternation among some jazz critics, who accused Davis of betraying the essence of jazz.[10] Music critic Kevin Fellezs commented that some members of the jazz community regarded rock music as less sophisticated and more commercial than jazz.[11]

Davis's 1969 album In a Silent Way is considered his first fusion album.[12] Composed of two side-long improvised suites edited heavily by Teo Macero, the album was made by pioneers of jazz fusion: Corea, Hancock, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and John McLaughlin.

A Tribute to Jack Johnson (1971) has been cited as ""the purest electric jazz record ever made"" and ""one of the most remarkable jazz rock discs of the era"".[13][14]

According to music journalist Zaid Mudhaffer, the term ""jazz fusion"" was coined in a review of Song of Innocence by David Axelrod when it was released in 1968.[15] Axelrod said Davis had played the album before conceiving Bitches Brew.[16]

Miles Davis was one of the first jazz musicians to incorporate jazz fusion into his material. He also proved to be a good judge of talented sidemen. Several of the players he chose for his early fusion work went on to success in their own bands. His guitar player John McLaughlin branched out, forming his own fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra. Blending Indian classical music, jazz, and psychedelic rock, they created a whole new style just as Davis had. Davis's live albums during this period, including Live-Evil and Miles Davis at Fillmore, featured McLaughlin.

Davis dropped out of music in 1975 because of problems with drugs and alcohol, but his sidemen took advantage of the creative and financial vistas that had been opened. Herbie Hancock brought elements of funk, disco, and electronic music into commercially successful albums such as Head Hunters (1973) and Feets, Don't Fail Me Now (1979). Several years after recording Miles in the Sky with Davis, guitarist George Benson became a vocalist with enough pop hits to overshadow his earlier career in jazz.[9]

While Davis was sidelined, Chick Corea gained prominence. In the early 1970s Corea combined jazz, rock, pop, and Brazilian music in Return to Forever, a band that included Stanley Clarke on bass guitar and Al Di Meola on electric guitar. Corea divided the rest of his career between acoustic and electric music, non-commercial and commercial, jazz and pop rock, with a band for each: the Akoustic Band and the Elektric Band.[9]

Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter started very influential jazz fusion band Weather Report in 1970 and developed successful career along with major musicians like Alphonse Mouzon, Jaco Pastorius, Airto Moreira and Miroslav Vitouš until 1986.

Tony Williams was a member of Davis's band since 1963. Williams reflected, ""I wanted to create a different atmosphere from the one I had been in...What better way to do it than to go electric?"" He left Davis to form the Tony Williams Lifetime with English guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young. The band combined rock intensity and loudness with jazz spontaneity. The debut album Emergency! was recorded three months before Bitches Brew.[7][17][18]

Although McLaughlin had worked with Miles Davis, he was influenced more by Jimi Hendrix and had played with English rock musicians Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger before creating the Mahavishnu Orchestra around the same time that Corea started Return to Forever. McLaughlin had been a member of Tony Williams's Lifetime. He brought to his music many of the elements that interested other musicians in the 1960s and early 1970s: counterculture, rock and roll, electronic instruments, solo virtuosity, experimentation, the blending of genres, and an interest in the exotic, such as Indian music.[9] He formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra with drummer Billy Cobham, violinist Jerry Goodman, bassist Rick Laird, and keyboardist Jan Hammer. The band released its first album, The Inner Mounting Flame, in 1971. Hammer pioneered the use of the Minimoog synthesizer with distortion effects. His use of the pitch bend wheel made a keyboard sound like an electric guitar. The Mahavishnu Orchestra was influenced by both psychedelic rock and Indian classical music. The band's first lineup broke up after two studio albums and one live album, but McLaughlin formed another group in 1974 under the same name with jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, one of the first electric violinists.

After leaving the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1975 Jean-Luc Ponty signed with Atlantic and released number of successfull jazz fusion solo albums that entered top 5 of the Billboard jazz charts in mid '70s — '80s.

During the late 1970s, Lee Ritenour, Stuff, George Benson, Spyro Gyra, the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton[19] released fusion albums.

The term ""jazz-rock"" (or ""jazz/rock"") is sometimes used as a synonym for ""jazz fusion"". The Free Spirits have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz rock band.[20]

Rock bands such as Colosseum, Chicago, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chase,[21]Soft Machine, Nucleus, Brand X, the Mothers of Invention and IF blended jazz and rock with electric instruments.[22]  Davis' fusion jazz was ""pure melody and tonal color"",[22] while Frank Zappa's music was more ""complex"" and ""unpredictable"".[23] Zappa released the solo album Hot Rats in 1969.[24] The album contained long instrumental pieces with a jazz influence.[25][26] Zappa released two albums, The Grand Wazoo and Waka/Jawaka, in 1972 which were influenced by jazz. George Duke and Aynsley Dunbar played on both. 1970s band Steely Dan has been lauded by music critic Neil McCormick for their ""smooth, smart jazz-rock fusion.""[27]

The jazz artists of the 1960s and 1970s had a large impact on many rock groups of that era such as Santana and Frank Zappa. They took jazz phrasing and harmony and incorporated it into modern rock music, significantly changing music history and paving the way for artists that would follow in their footsteps. Carlos Santana in particular has given much credit to Miles Davis and the influence he had on his music. While Miles Davis combined jazz with modal and rock influences, Carlos Santana combined these along with Latin rhythms and feel, shaping a whole new genre, Latin rock. Other rock artists such as Gary Moore, The Grateful Dead, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, and The Allman Brothers Band have taken influences from blues, jazz, blues rock, jazz rock and incorporated it into their own music.

According to AllMusic, the term jazz rock ""may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation...jazz rock first emerged during the late '60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer-songwriter movement.""[28]

According to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, jazz rock paralleled free jazz by being ""on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s"". He said the albums Emergency! (1969) by the Tony Williams Lifetime and Agharta (1975) by Miles Davis ""suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before."" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre ""mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio"" at the end of the 1970s.[29]

In the 1970s, American fusion was being combined in the U.K. with progressive rock and psychedelic music. Bands who were part of this movement included Brand X (with Phil Collins of Genesis), Bruford (Bill Bruford of Yes), Nucleus (led by Ian Carr), and Soft Machine. Throughout Europe and the world this movement grew due to bands like Magma in France, Passport in Germany, Time, Leb i Sol and September in Yugoslavia, and guitarists Jan Akkerman (The Netherlands), Volker Kriegel (Germany), Terje Rypdal (Norway), Jukka Tolonen (Finland), Ryo Kawasaki (Japan), and Kazumi Watanabe (Japan).[7]

Jazz metal is the fusion of jazz fusion and jazz rock with heavy metal. Animals as Leaders' albums The Joy of Motion (2014) and The Madness of Many (2016) have been described as progressive metal combined with jazz fusion.[30]Panzerballett blends jazz with heavy metal.[31]

Jazz pop (or pop-jazz, also called jazzy pop) is pop music with jazz instruments, soft production, commercially viable, and radio-friendly.[32] In jazz pop, the music has less improvisation, but retains the melody and swing of jazz.[33] Robert Palmer from The New York Times cited that jazz pop should be distinguished from jazz rock.[34] Examples of jazz-pop musicians are Kenny G, Bob James, and George Benson.

By the early 1980s, much of the original fusion genre was subsumed into other branches of jazz and rock, especially smooth jazz, a radio-friendly subgenre of fusion which is influenced by R&B, funk, and pop music.[35] Smooth jazz can be traced to at least the late 1960s, when producer Creed Taylor worked with guitarist Wes Montgomery on three popular music-oriented albums. Taylor founded CTI Records and many established jazz performers recorded for CTI, including Freddie Hubbard, Chet Baker, George Benson, and Stanley Turrentine. Albums under Taylor's guidance were aimed at both pop and jazz fans.[citation needed]

The merging of jazz and pop/rock music took a more commercial direction in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the form of compositions with a softer sound palette that could fit comfortably in a soft rock radio playlist. The AllMusic guide's article on fusion states that ""unfortunately, as it became a money-maker and as rock declined artistically from the mid-'70s on, much of what was labeled fusion was actually a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B.""[6]

Michael and Randy Brecker produced funk-influenced jazz with soloists.[36] David Sanborn was considered a ""soulful"" and ""influential"" voice.[36] However, Kenny G was criticized by both fusion and jazz fans, and some musicians, while having become a huge commercial success. Music reviewer George Graham argues that the ""so-called 'smooth jazz' sound of people like Kenny G has none of the fire and creativity that marked the best of the fusion scene during its heyday in the 1970s.""[37]

In the 1990s, another kind of fusion took a more hardcore approach. Bill Laswell produced many albums in this movement, such as Ask the Ages by avant-garde guitarist Sonny Sharrock and Arc of the Testimony with Laswell's band Arcana. Niacin (band) was formed by rock bassist Billy Sheehan, drummer Dennis Chambers, and organist John Novello.[7]

In London, The Pop Group began to mix free jazz and reggae into their form of punk rock.[38] In New York City, no wave was inspired by free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch's Queen of Siam,[39]James Chance and the Contortions, who mixed soul music with free jazz and punk rock, and the Lounge Lizards,[39] the first group to call themselves punk jazz.[39]

John Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock and incorporated them into free jazz with the release of the Spy vs Spy album in 1986. The album was a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes played in the thrashcore style.[40] In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a blend of thrash and free jazz.[41]

Jazz-funk is characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds,[42] and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.[43]

Jazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club-circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Jazz-funk retains a stronger feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production, and is more arranged and features more improvisation than soul jazz.

M-Base (""macro-basic array of structured extemporization"") centers on a movement started in the 1980s. It started as a group of young African-American musicians in New York which included Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developing a complex but grooving sound.[44] In the 1990s most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.[45][46] M-Base changed from a loose collective to an informal ""school"".[47]

Afro-Cuban jazz, one of the earliest forms of Latin jazz, is a fusion of Afro-Cuban clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban jazz emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauza and Frank Grillo ""Machito"" in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. In 1947 the collaborations of bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the congas and the bongos, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as Gillespie's and Pozo's ""Manteca"" and Charlie Parker's and Machito's ""Mangó Mangüé"", were commonly referred to as ""Cubop"", short for Cuban bebop.[48] During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba.[49]

According to bassist Randy Jackson, jazz fusion is a difficult genre to play. ""I ... picked jazz fusion because I was trying to become the ultimate technical musician—able to play anything. Jazz fusion to me is the hardest music to play. You have to be so proficient on your instrument. Playing five tempos at the same time, for instance. I wanted to try the toughest music because I knew if I could do that, I could do anything.""[50]

Progressive rock, with its affinity for long solos, diverse influences, non-standard time signatures, and complex music had very similar musical values as jazz fusion. Some prominent examples of progressive rock mixed with elements of fusion is the music of Gong, King Crimson, Ozric Tentacles, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.

Jazz rock fusion's technically challenging guitar solos, bass solos, and odd-metered, syncopated drumming started to be incorporated in the technically focused progressive metal genre in the early 1990s. The death metal band Atheist produced albums Unquestionable Presence in 1991 and Elements in 1993 containing heavily syncopated drumming, changing time signatures, instrumental parts, acoustic interludes, and Latin rhythms. Meshuggah first attracted international attention with the 1995 release Destroy Erase Improve for its fusion of fast-tempo death metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal with jazz fusion elements. Cynic recorded a complex, unorthodox form of jazz fusion influenced experimental death metal with their 1993 album Focus. In 1997, Guitar Institute of Technology guitarist Jennifer Batten under the name of Jennifer Batten's Tribal Rage: Momentum released Momentum—an instrumental hybrid of rock, fusion, and exotic sounds. Mudvayne is heavily influenced by jazz, especially in bassist Ryan Martinie's playing.[51][52]Puya frequently incorporates influences from American and Latin jazz music.[53]

Another, more cerebral, all-instrumental progressive jazz fusion-metal band Planet X released Universe in 2000 with Tony MacAlpine, Derek Sherinian (ex-Dream Theater), and Virgil Donati (who has played with Scott Henderson from Tribal Tech). The band blends fusion-style guitar solos and syncopated odd-metered drumming with the heaviness of metal. Tech-prog-fusion metal band Aghora formed in 1995 and released their first album, self-titled Aghora, recorded in 1999 with Sean Malone and Sean Reinert, both former members of Cynic. Gordian Knot, another Cynic-linked experimental progressive metal band, released its debut album in 1999 which explored a range of styles from jazz fusion to metal. The Mars Volta is extremely influenced by jazz fusion, using progressive, unexpected turns in the drum patterns and instrumental lines. The style of Uzbek prog band Fromuz is described as ""prog fusion"". In lengthy instrumental jams the band transitions from fusion of rock and ambient world music to jazz and progressive hard rock tones.[54]"
"K-pop","K-pop (Korean: 케이팝; RR: keipap), short for Korean popular music,[1] is a form of popular music originating in South Korea as part of South Korean culture.[2] It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&B, rock, jazz, gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots.[3] The term K-pop became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. The Korean term for domestic pop music is gayo (가요; 歌謠), which is still widely used within South Korea.[4][5] While K-pop can refer to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, it is colloquially often used in a narrower sense for any Korean music and artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless of the genre.[contradictory]
The more modern form of the genre, originally termed rap dance, emerged with the formation of the hip hop boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.[6]
Modern K-pop idol culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults.[7][8] After a slump in early idol music, from 2003, TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today.[9][10] With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia, but also throughout the world, gaining an international audience.
In 2018, K-pop experienced significant growth and became a power player, marking a 17.9% increase in revenue growth. As of 2019, Korean popular music is ranked at number six among the top ten music markets worldwide according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's Global Music Report 2019, with BTS and Blackpink cited as artists leading the market growth.[11] In 2020, K-pop experienced a record-breaking year when it experienced a 44.8% growth and positioned itself as the fastest-growing major market of the year.[12]"
"Latin pop","

Latin pop (in Spanish and in Portuguese: Pop Latino) is a pop music subgenre that is a fusion of US–style music production with Latin music genres from anywhere in Latin America and Spain.[1] Originating with Spanish-speaking musicians,[2] Latin pop may also be made by musicians in Portuguese (mainly in Brazilian Portuguese) and the various Romance Creole languages. Latin pop usually combines upbeat Latin music with American pop music.[3] Latin pop is commonly associated with Spanish-language pop, rock, and dance music.[4]

Latin pop is one of the most popular Latin music genres today. However, before the arrival of artists like Alejandro Sanz, Thalía, Luis Miguel, Selena, Paulina Rubio, Shakira, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin, Gloria Trevi and Enrique Iglesias, Latin pop first reached a global audience through the work of bandleader Sergio Mendes in the mid-1960s,[5] although artists like Carmen Miranda popularized Latin samba music in Hollywood decades before this. In later decades, it was defined by the romantic ballads that legendary artists such as Julio Iglesias or Roberto Carlos produced in the 1970s.[6]

Ricky Martin is considered to be the King of Latin Pop.[7]

Latin pop became the most popular form of Latin music in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, with acts such as Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, even achieving massive crossover success among non-Latino listeners during the late 1990s. While not restricted to America by any means, Latin pop was profoundly affected by production techniques and other styles of music – both Latin and otherwise – that originated primarily in the United States. Tejano music, centered in Texas and the United States/Mexico border region, had begun to introduce synthesizers, slicker production, and a more urban sensibility to formerly root styles like norteño and conjunto.

Moreover, New York and Miami were home to thriving Latin club scenes, which during the 1980s led to the rise of Latin freestyle, a club-oriented dance music that was rooted in Latin rhythms but relied on synthesizers and drum machines for most of its arrangements. Both of these sounds influenced the rise of Latin pop, which retained Latin rhythms in its uptempo numbers but relied more on mainstream pop for its melodic sense.

Latin pop's first major crossover star was Gloria Estefan, who scored a succession of non-club-oriented dance-pop hits during the mid- to late 1980s, but eventually became known more as an adult contemporary diva with an affinity for sweeping ballads. This blend of Latinized dance-pop and adult contemporary balladeering dominated Latin pop through the 1990s. Most of its artists sang in Spanish for Latino audiences, although Latin pop's similarity to the mainstream helped several performers score crossover hits when they chose to record in English. Jon Secada landed several pop hits during the mid-1990s, and Tejano pop star Selena's album Dreaming of You actually debuted posthumously at number one on the album charts upon its 1995 release.[1]

The late '90s and early 2000s saw Latin artists such as Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez and ex-husband Marc Anthony, Paulina Rubio, Jade Esteban Estrada, Thalía, among others, achieve crossover mainstream success. Other traditionally pop artists also made forays into Latin pop either finding success experimenting with the sound, such as Debelah Morgan and 98 Degrees, or recording Spanish versions of their songs or albums, such as Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, to name a few.[8][9]"
"New Romantic","Many bands that emerged from the New Romantic movement became closely associated with the use of synthesizers to create rock and pop music, which has led to the widespread misconception that synth-pop and the New Romantic movement were synonymous. Synth-pop was prefigured in the 1960s and 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco, the Kraut rock of bands like Kraftwerk, the three albums made by Bowie with Brian Eno in his Berlin period, and Yellow Magic Orchestra's early albums.
After the breakthrough of Tubeway Army and Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound and they came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s. Bands that emerged from the New Romantic scene and adopted synth-pop included Duran Duran, Visage, and Spandau Ballet.[43] According to authors Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy, After the monochrome blacks and greys of punk/new wave, synthpop was promoted by a youth media interested in people who wanted to be pop stars, such as Boy George and Adam Ant.[20]
Early synth-pop has been described as eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing, using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop.[44] Duran Duran, who emerged from the Birmingham scene, have been credited with incorporating a dance-orientated rhythm section into synth-pop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles.[44]
While many groups associated with the New Romantic movement used synthesizers, some avoided them entirely or made limited use of them. Boy George's band Culture Club, which formed in 1981, produced a sound that combined elements of Motown, Philly soul, reggae and lovers’ rock.[45] Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow used the African-influenced rhythms of the Burundi beat.[46]"
"Operatic pop","Operatic pop or popera is a subgenre of pop music that is performed in an operatic singing style or a song, theme or motif from classical music stylized as pop. The subgenre is often performed by classical crossover singers and acts, although that field is much broader in the types of music it encompasses. ""Popera"" performances, such as those by the Three Tenors, have reached larger audiences and brought in greater profits than typical for operatic music.[1]

According to music historians, operatic pop songs became most prevalent with the rise of Tin Pan Alley musicians during the early 1900s.[2] One influence was the large influx of Italian immigrants to the United States who popularized singers such as Enrico Caruso and inspired the creation of ""novelty songs"" using Italian dialect. The songs often used operatic repertory ""to make a satirical or topical point"".[2] Popularized by American Vaudeville, musical comedies, jazz and operettas, examples include Irving Berlin's That Opera Rag, Billy Murray's My Cousin Caruso and Louis Armstrong's riffs on Rigoletto and Pagliacci.[2] The subgenre subsequently dwindled after the 1920s but revived during the rock music era with albums such as The Who's Tommy and Queen's A Night at The Opera.[2]

In 1986, operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti had a hit with the Lucio Dalla song ""Caruso"", which helped to spark a recent flourishing of operatic pop.[3] Other singers, including Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, and Katherine Jenkins, also recorded the number.[3] Bocelli, in particular, soon became a leading representative of the subgenre[3][4] while his famous duet partner, British soprano Sarah Brightman, also gravitated considerably towards this combination of opera and pop music.[5] In the 2000s, singers and singing groups devoted primarily to operatic pop built on this renewed success. Groups like Il Divo and Amici Forever have achieved popularity with the mix of ""contemporary pop with operatic style"" characteristic of operatic pop.[6]"
"Pop rock","Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock[4]) is a fusion genre characterized by a strong commercial appeal,[5] with more emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude than standard rock music.[6][7][1] Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo-wop).[1]  It may be viewed as a distinct genre field rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock.[4]  The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less authentic than rock music.[8]

Much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms ""pop rock"" and ""power pop"" have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music.[9]  Writer Johan Fornas views pop/rock as ""one single, continuous genre field"", rather than distinct categories.[4] To the authors Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman, it is defined as an ""upbeat variety of rock music"" represented by artists and bands such as: Andy Kim, the Bells, Paul McCartney, Lighthouse, and Peter Frampton.[10]

The term pop has been used since the early forties to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.[11][1] In the aftermath of the British Invasion, from about 1967, it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.[12]

As of the 2010s, ""guitar pop rock"" and ""indie rock"" are roughly synonymous terms.[13] ""Jangle"" is a noun-adjective that music critics often use in reference to guitar pop with a bright mood.[14]

Critic Philip Auslander argues that the distinction between pop and rock is more pronounced in the US than in the UK. He claims that in the US, pop has roots in white crooners such as Perry Como, whereas rock is rooted in African-American music influenced by forms such as rock and roll. Auslander points out that the concept of pop rock, which blends pop and rock, is at odds with the typical conception of pop and rock as opposites. Auslander and several other scholars, such as Simon Frith and Grossberg, argue that pop music is often depicted as an inauthentic, cynical, ""slickly commercial"", and formulaic form of entertainment. In contrast, rock music is often heralded as an authentic, sincere, and anti-commercial form of music, which emphasizes songwriting by the singers and bands, instrumental virtuosity, and a ""real connection with the audience"".[15]

Frith's analysis of the history of popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s has been criticized by B. J. Moore-Gilbert, who argues that Frith and other scholars have overemphasized the role of rock in the history of popular music by naming every new genre using the ""rock"" suffix. Thus, when a folk-oriented style of music developed in the 1960s, Frith termed it ""folk rock"", and the pop-infused styles of the 1970s were called ""pop rock"". Moore-Gilbert claims that this approach unfairly puts rock at the apex and makes every other influence become an add-on to the central core of rock.[16]

In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau discussed the term ""pop-rock"" in the context of popular music's fragmentation along stylistic lines in the 1970s; he regarded ""pop-rock"" as a ""monolith"" that ""straddled"" all burgeoning movements and subgenres in the popular and semipopular music marketplace at the time, including singer-songwriter music, art rock, heavy metal, boogie, country rock, jazz fusion, funk, disco, urban contemporary, and new wave, but not punk rock.[17]"
"Pop-punk","Pop-punk (also punk-pop, alternatively spelled without the hyphen) is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with power pop or pop. It is defined by its fast-paced, energetic tempos, and emphasis on classic pop songcraft, as well as adolescent and anti-suburbia themes. It is distinguished from other punk-variant genres by drawing more heavily from 1960s bands such as the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Beach Boys. The genre has evolved throughout its history, absorbing elements from new wave, college rock, ska, rap, emo, boy band pop and even hardcore punk. It is sometimes considered interchangeable with power pop and skate punk.

Pop-punk emerged in the late 1970s with groups such as the Ramones, the Undertones, and the Buzzcocks setting the genre's groundwork. 1980s punk bands like Bad Religion, Descendents and the Misfits, while not necessarily pop-punk in and of themselves, were influential to pop-punk, and it expanded in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a host of bands signed to Lookout! Records, including Screeching Weasel, the Queers, and the Mr. T Experience. In the mid-1990s, the genre saw a widespread popularity increase and entered the mainstream with bands like Green Day and the Offspring. The genre experienced another wave popularized during the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Blink-182, and in their wake followed contemporary acts such as Sum 41, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, and Avril Lavigne, while the Warped Tour played a crucial role as a launching platform for up-and-coming pop-punk artists, turning countless acts into success.[2]

Pop-punk's mainstream popularity continued in the mid-to-late 2000s, with artists such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Paramore achieving high levels of commercial success. By this point, pop-punk acts were largely indistinguishable from artists tagged as ""emo"", to the extent that emo crossover acts such as Fall Out Boy and Paramore popularized a pop-punk-influenced style dubbed emo pop. By the 2010s, pop-punk's mainstream popularity had waned, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. During this period, however, a wave of underground artists defined a rawer and more emotional take on the genre, namely the Story so Far, the Wonder Years and Neck Deep. In the early 2020s, a new crop of pop-punk music began experiencing mainstream resurgence with various new acts such as Machine Gun Kelly, KennyHoopla and Yungblud.

Pop-punk is variously described as a punk subgenre,[3][4] a variation of punk,[5][6][7] a form of pop music,[8] and a genre antithetical to punk in a similar manner as post-punk.[7] It has evolved stylistically throughout its history, absorbing elements from new wave, college rock, ska, rap, emo, and boy bands.[6] Writers at The A.V. Club described pop-punk as a punk subgenre that has ""essentially been around as long as punk itself"" with roots in the ""classic pop of the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Beach Boys, often pitting sweet harmonies against bratty, rowdy riffs.""[3] According to Ryan Cooper of About.com, ""pop-punk is a style that owes more to The Beatles and '60s pop than other sub-genres of punk"".[4]

There is considerable overlap between power pop and pop-punk, and the two styles are often conflated.[3] Web publication Revolver acknowledged that, while pop-punk and power pop are often presented interchangeably, ""the core concept is simple—melodic songs packaged with a punk slant.""[9] In Brian Cogan's The Encyclopedia of Punk Music and Culture (2006) pop-punk is characterized as ""a catchy, faster version of power pop.""[10]AllMusic defines ""punk-pop"" as ""a post-grunge strand of alternative rock"" that combines the textures and fast tempos of punk rock with the ""melodies and chord changes"" of power pop.[11] In the 1990s, there was overlap between pop-punk and skate punk.[12] Music journalist Ben Myers wrote that the two terms were synonymous.[13]

Rock writer Greg Shaw, who wrote extensively about power pop and took credit for codifying the genre in the 1970s, originally defined power pop itself as a hybrid style of punk and pop.[14]Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, who described power pop as ""the greatest music on Earth that no one likes"",[15] opined that the pop-punk term was an oxymoron: ""You're either punk or you're not.""[6] Writing in Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Guide to Power Pop (2007), actor Robbie Rist felt that much of the genre merely consisted of pop bands who ""add the 'punk' moniker so the kids will think they are pissing off their parents.""[8]

Even during its formative phase in 1978, pop-punk wasn't simply a lighter, more palatable version of punk. It was just as rebellious, only it rebelled against punk itself: its nihilism, its bad-boy pose, its mockery of melody, it's belittling of sentimentality, and above all, its self-seriousness. In a way, pop punk became its own kind of post-punk...

—Vice writer Jason Heller[7]

Rolling Stone, in an article about pop-punk, wrote that the term was a retroactive label for punk bands who had ""always championed great songwriting alongside their anti-authoritarian stance. And punk's focus on speed, concision and three-chord simplicity is a natural fit with pop's core values.""[6]Vice's Jason Heller described ""an open respect for the tradition and craft of pop songwriting"" as a key characteristic of pop-punk.[7] Bill Lamb, also from About.com, writes that pop-punk is a variant of punk music that features ""a hard and fast guitar and drums base but powered by pop melodies like much of '70s punk rock.""[16]Alter the Press! defines pop-punk as ""a genre that originates from mixing punk rock with pop sensibility"".[5]

Lyrically, pop-punk often addresses adolescent themes of lust, romantic relationships, heartbreak, drugs, suburbia, and rebellion.[3][17] Some pop-punk lyrics make an emphasis on jokes and humor.[3]The New Yorker's Amanda Petrush summarized that the ""rawness"" of pop-punk ""lies not in the music"" but by conveying the ""spectrum of human experience, all that longing and self-doubt.""[6]

The term pop punk was first used by John Rockwell in a March 1977 New York Times article to describe Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.[18]

Punk rock has long shared sensibilities with pop music, especially since the late 1970s.[13] In his book Rock and Roll: A Social History (2018), author Paul Friedlander lists the following English artists as representative of the ""new wave of pop punk synthesis"" that occurred in the late 1970s: Elvis Costello and the Attractions, the Police, the Jam, Billy Idol, Joe Jackson, the Pretenders, UB40, Madness, the Specials, the English Beat. Likewise, among American acts, Friedlander references Talking Heads, Blondie, the B-52s, the Motels, and Pere Ubu.[19]

Heller said that the Ramones crafted a blueprint for pop-punk with their 1976 debut album, but 1978 was the year that the genre ""came into its own"".[7] He noted that some bands ""were unmistakably pop punk bands by today's definition of the term, but in 1978, the distinction wasn't so clear. Plenty of punk groups of the era threw a token pop tune or two into their set—sometimes for ironic effect, other times earnestly.""[7] Heller also acknowledged that many ""burgeoning pop punk groups in 1978 bordered on power pop, a parallel genre on the rise at the time. But power pop began earlier, and it was a more American phenomenon"".[7] Among the influential pop-punk bands of the late 1970s were the Buzzcocks.[21] An LA Weekly writer later referred to the band's 1979 compilation album Singles Going Steady as ""the blueprint for punk rock bands preferring tuneful tales of lost love and longing to rage against the machine.""[22] Cooper similarly cited the album as one of punk's most influential and added that Buzzcocks' ""pop overtones [led] them to be a primary influence on today's pop punk bands."".[23] Heller referred to the Undertones as ""the most subversive band"" of the genre during this period, particularly their 1978 single ""Teenage Kicks"", ""one of the most striking and definitive pop punk classics.""[7]

Bad Religion, formed in 1979, helped to lay the groundwork for the pop-punk style that emerged in the 1990s.[24] They and some of the other leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to Myers, Bad Religion ""layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies"". Myers added that another band, the Descendents, ""wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)"".[13] Their positive yet sarcastic approach began to separate them from the more serious hardcore scene. The Descendents' 1982 debut LP Milo Goes to College provided the template for the United States' take on the more melodic strains of first wave punk.[22] Many pop-punk bands, including Blink-182, cite the Descendents as a major influence. Descendents paved the way for future pop-punk bands with themes of hating parents, struggling to find a romantic partner, and social alienation. Horror punk band The Misfits also influenced pop-punk with their 1982 album Walk Among Us, which was a forerunner to later pop-punk music with the album's vocal harmonies and pop-inspired melodies. The Misfits' gothic image inspired later pop-punk bands like Alkaline Trio and My Chemical Romance. Marginal Man was a Washington D.C. hardcore punk band who mixed hardcore punk with melodic chord progressions and clean, melodic singing, being influenced by power pop, jangle pop and new wave music.[25]

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, pop-punk bands such as Green Day, the Queers, The Mr. T Experience and Screeching Weasel emerged from the record label Lookout! Records with a sound indebted to Buzzcocks, the Ramones, and the Undertones.[26][27][7] In August 1992, early 1990s California punk rock and pop-punk was noticed by the magazine Spin when the magazine published a story called ""California Screamin'"", which is about the early 1990s underground punk rock scene in California, mentioning pop-punk bands like Screeching Weasel and Green Day.[28] Screeching Weasel's 1991 album My Brain Hurts influenced many subsequent pop-punk bands,[29] with bands like Blink-182, Allister[30] and Alkaline Trio[31] citing them as an influence.[32]Social Distortion, known for playing genres like traditional punk and cowpunk, achieved moderate success starting in the early 1990s prior to the 1994 mainstream explosion of pop punk.[25] The band's self-titled album (1990) and Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell (1992) both eventually were certified gold in the United States.[33][34]

In the wake of Nirvana and grunge breaking through in the early 1990s, California's Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels in 1993, and by 1994, pop-punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity, soon before grunge's popularity began to decline. Many punk rock and pop-punk bands originated from the California punk scene of the late 1980s, and several of those bands, especially Green Day and the Offspring, helped revive interest in punk rock in the 1990s.[35] Green Day arose from the 924 Gilman Street punk scene in Berkeley, California.[36] After building an underground following, the band signed to Reprise Records and released their major-label debut album, Dookie, in 1994. Dookie sold four million copies by the year's end and spawned several radio singles that received extensive MTV rotation, three of which peaked at number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[37] Green Day's enormous commercial success paved the way for other North American pop-punk bands in the following decade.[38] In 1999, Dookie was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[39] The Offspring also achieved mainstream success in 1994 with their album Smash being certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.[40]

MTV and radio stations such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM played a major role in the genre's mainstream success.[41] The Warped Tour, started in 1995, brought punk even further into the United States mainstream.[42] With punk rock's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk subculture that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream.[41] Some punk rock fans criticized Green Day for ""selling out"" and rejected their music as too soft, pop-oriented and not legitimate punk rock.[37][43][44] They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge.[45]

In 1997, Blink-182 released their breakthrough album, Dude Ranch, and the band performed at the Vans Warped Tour that year. ""Dammit"", the album's second single, received frequent airplay on modern rock stations, and the album was certified gold by 1998.[46] By 1999, Blink achieved further mainstream success with Enema of the State. In the description of journalist Matt Crane, the record initiated ""a new wave of pop punk"". He added, ""At any given time in the late '90s/early 2000s, it was not uncommon to see Blink-182 and Sum 41 on MTV. You couldn't escape it. Pop punk was in, and it became the undisputed mainstream choice.""[20] Lamb described second-wave pop-punk bands, led by Blink-182, as having ""a radio friendly sheen to their music, but still maintaining much of the speed and attitude of classic punk rock"".[16]Enema of the State was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA[47] and its song ""All the Small Things"" peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.[48] Sum 41's debut album All Killer No Filler was certified triple platinum in their home country of Canada.[49] Its song ""Fat Lip"" peaked at number one on the US Billboard alternative airplay chart[50] and number eight on the UK singles chart.[51]

Around this time the genre saw the rise of the ""Drive-Thru Records Era"", where a number of bands that were signed to independent record labels gained mainstream attention, namely those on Drive-Thru Records. This included bands such as New Found Glory, Allister, Fenix TX, the Early November, Something Corporate, the Starting Line, Midtown, Hellogoodbye, Rx Bandits and the Movielife.[52] A 2017 article by Upset Magazine called New Found Glory ""pop punk's most consistent and influential bands for 20 years""[53] and the Starting Line's song ""Best of Me"" was cited by Alternative Press as one of the most influential songs in the genre.[54]

Avril Lavigne's 2002 album Let Go set a precedent for the success of female-fronted pop-punk acts. Journalist Nick Laugher wrote that it was ""undeniable"" that the record launched pop-punk into the mainstream, ""blurring the lines with it and straight-up pop music, and making it more of a cultural movement than a genre.""[55] Other critics and publications noticed that because of Lavigne's punk-driven-pop anthems,[56][57][58] she has earned the reputation as the genre's ""queen"".[59][60] For her part, Lavigne preferred to describe her music as ""heavy pop rock"", rather than punk.[61][62] Other pop-punk bands that achieved popularity include Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and MxPx.[20] Good Charlotte's 2002 album The Young and the Hopeless went triple platinum.[63] Simple Plan's 2002 debut album No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls was certified double platinum[64] and its 2004 follow-up Still Not Getting Any... went platinum.[65]

In the United Kingdom, Busted and McFly gained notability through merging pop-punk musicality with boy band aesthetics.[66][67] Busted's 2002 self-titled debut album was certified 4× platinum[68] and their second album A Present for Everyone was certified 3× platinum.[69] McFly's 2004 debut album Room on the 3rd Floor peaked at number one on the UK albums chart[70] and was certified 2× platinum.[71]

As emo pop's merger of pop-punk emo coalesced, the record label Fueled by Ramen became a center of the movement, releasing platinum selling albums from bands like Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco and Paramore. Fall Out Boy's 2005 song ""Sugar, We're Goin Down"" received heavy airplay, climbing to number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 music charts.[72]Plain White T's was another Illinois emo pop band that received major mainstream success. Their album Every Second Counts (2006) went number 10 on the Billboard 200 charts and featured their number one single ""Hey There Delilah"".[73] New Jersey band My Chemical Romance was one of the faces of emo pop during the 2000s. MCR's albums Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (2004) and The Black Parade (2006) each sold more than 3 million copies in the US alone. The latter of the albums debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts. The album's lead single ""Welcome to the Black Parade"" topped the US Alternative Songs chart and reached number 9 on the Billboard hot 100.[74]Taking Back Sunday's third album Louder Now (2006) debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts.[75]

According to Brooklyn Vegan's Andrew Sacher, after the success of ""hugely popular"" 2000s bands such as Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and My Chemical Romance, ""the line between pop punk and emo look[ed] close to nonexistent.""[76] Several pop-punk bands took different musical directions in the late 2000s, with Panic! at the Disco crafting the Beatles-inspired, baroque-styled record Pretty. Odd. (2008) and Fall Out Boy experimenting with glam rock, blues rock and R&B on Folie a Deux (2008), both of which created fan confusion and backlash. Folie a Deux sold worse than their preceding albums, a representation of the backlash from their fanbase as the group experimented with a musical style differing from their established pop-punk sound.[77][78]

The late-2000s also saw the pioneering of neon pop-punk, a style of pop-punk that embraced more elements of pop and electronic music than was traditional in the genre.[79] Popular groups in the style at the time included All Time Low, the Maine, the Cab,[79]Metro Station,[80]Boys Like Girls, Cobra Starship and Forever the Sickest Kids.[81] Metro Station's 2007 single ""Shake It"" peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100[82] and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart.[83] All Time Low's 2008 single ""Dear Maria, Count Me In"" is certified double platinum in the United States,[84] and their 2009 album Nothing Personal peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Digital Albums chart.[85] The Maine's 2008 debut album Can't Stop Won't Stop peaked at number 9 on the Billboard digital albums chart.[86] Cobra Starship's 2009 album Hot Mess reached number 4 on the Billboard 200.[87] Boys Like Girls' 2009 second album Love Drunk peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart.[88]

Pop-punk lost its mainstream popularity in the early 2010s, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio.[89] Some acts, such as New Found Glory, have seen concert attendance numbers decrease steadily.[90] Devon Maloney of MTV wrote that ""Pop punk and emo bands don't headline Coachella or Bonnaroo; they rarely, if ever, are even billed on mainstream festival stages,"" and notes that it has similarly disappeared from the press. The only magazines that featured pop-punk bands were niche publications such as Alternative Press and the occasional teen magazine, while influential pop-punk magazine AMP ceased publication in 2013.[91] The decline in mainstream popularity for the genre, coupled with the closure of many mid-size venues associated with it, resulted in many venues and labels returning to the DIY ethic that helped spawn the punk movement.[92][93][failed verification]

By 2012, pop-punk bands that had achieved minimal mainstream success had seen a return to grassroots form, considered ""the micro-operation style that yielded the results that caught the mainstream's attention in the first place.""[91]Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory wrote in an op-ed for Alternative Press entitled ""Why Pop-Punk's Not Dead—And Why It Still Matters Today"": ""This isn't a dead genre, and just because there isn't a song on the radio to clarify that shouldn't matter. ... Pop-punk means something to a lot of people and to me, having success as a band in our genre is about longevity, touring a lot and staying true to your fans.""[90]

By the 2010s, many pop-punk bands had folded; ""once essentially child stars, their members are now adult musicians hoping to move beyond the teen trappings that gave them careers.""[91] Fall Out Boy and Paramore, two groups that achieved mainstream success within the genre, had two number one albums—Save Rock and Roll and Paramore—side by side on the Billboard 200. Fall Out Boy along with other pop-punk bands that peaked during the mid-2000s began experimenting with the more pop side of pop punk, in order to maintain their relevancy and keep the interest of their fanbase while gaining the appeal of the newer generations that may not like their traditional sound or relate as much to the punk themes of the 1970s.[94] Their popularity provoked conversations about the state of the genre; Maloney opined that these records could not be viewed as pop-punk.[91]

In the early 2010s, a new wave of pop-punk groups emerged,[95][96] fronted by the Wonder Years, State Champs, Neck Deep, Real Friends and Knuckle Puck.[97] Dave Beech of Clash noted that these groups were ""[d]arker and more mature"" than those previously, taking influence ""and occasional indifference"" from 1990s emo.[96] Music commentator Finn McKenty also cited the influence from hardcore punk as being prominent during this period.[97] On the Wonder Years' The Upsides (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about ""His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife"" which ""resonated with a [new] generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process.""[98] This pushed Campbell to ""the forefront of a new wave"", and the album influenced a new wave of pop-punk bands.[98]Rock Sound included The Wonder Years' The Greatest Generation on their best albums of 2013 list, calling it ""the defining album of what may well have been the genre's best year for a decade.""[99]Kerrang! said the album ""ripped up the pop punk blueprint"" pushing the genre to ""new peaks of invention, both lyrically and musically.""[100]The Story So Far's What You Don't See (2013) ""cemented their place at the top table of nu pop punk"".[101] In early 2014, Welsh band Neck Deep released their debut album Wishful Thinking, which Rock Sound later called it ""the greatest UK pop punk record of all time.""[102] During this period, Man Overboard's ""Defend Pop Punk"" shirt design, which featured an AK-47, became a popular symbol of the scene,[103] to the extent that a number of publication have posthumously described this period as the ""Defend Pop Punk Era"".[104][105][106]

I think pop-punk is a zombie. ... It hushed down for a bit but then it got brought back to life in an almost undead fashion. ... Back then it was mainstream, you would see it on MTV and things like that. Now, it's different, it's got a fighting chance and it's crawling its way back up. It started out with a pretty selective crowd but now it's opening up to more and more people.[107]

Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer's 2014 self titled album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and in many other countries,[108] and received what the Guardian journalist Harriet Gibsone described as ""the kind of mania only ever granted to a massive boyband"".[109] However, the band's status as pop-punk was controversial. Alternative Press described the band as important to the marketing of the pop-punk scene,[108] whereas in a Clash magazine interview with Terry Bezer, he described them as ""not pop-punk... [but] a valuable gateway for young kids to begin taking their first steps towards bands of... more substance.""[110] Around this time, a number of other pop-punk-influenced pop artists gained mainstream attention, including Charli XCX[111] and Halsey.[112]

Several pop-punk bands embarked on anniversary tours in the early to mid-2010s, playing some of their most popular albums in full. While some members of these bands have had mixed feelings about these performances, quite often these tours sell as well as or better than the first time around.[91] Club promoters in the UK have created nights based around lasting appreciation of the genre.[113] The Warped Tour still attracts hundreds of thousands of attendees each year; the 2012 tour attracted 556,000 festival-goers, its third-best attendance.[91] Bobby Olivier of The Star-Ledger wrote: ""The genre ... continues to reinvent itself and Warped is pop punk's prom.""[114]

In 2016, Rolling Stone reported that pop-punk was ""still one of the most predominant and popular rock genres"". The magazine conducted a reader's poll for the ""10 Best Pop-Punk Albums of All Time"" that ultimately included Green Day (Dookie, American Idiot, Nimrod), Blink-182 (Enema of the State, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, Dude Ranch), the Ramones (Ramones), the Offspring (Smash), Jimmy Eat World (Bleed American), and Generation X (Valley of the Dolls).[115]

In the late 2010s, the genre was influential in the development of emo rap. Many emo rappers gained mainstream attention during this period. In particular, Lil Peep, Lil Uzi Vert, Juice WRLD and XXXTentacion were all vocal about their love for and influence from pop-punk.[116][117] Emo rapper Wicca Phase Springs Eternal was even a member of the influential 2010s pop-punk band Tigers Jaw.[118] This brought about a revived interest in the genre in popular culture,[116][117] leading to a number notable artists beginning to release po- punk songs towards the end of the decade. Emo rapper Lil Aaron and pop singer Kim Petras released the pop-punk song ""Anymore"" on September 5, 2018.[119] On 13 February 2019, Yungblud and pop singer Halsey released the pop-punk song ""11 Minutes"" featuring Travis Barker.[120] The song was certified gold in the United States,[121] peaked at number one on the Billboard Bubbling under Top 100 chart[122] and was performed at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[123] On June 7, 2019, Machine Gun Kelly, who had been established as a rapper for over a decade, released the pop-punk song ""I Think I'm Okay"" featuring Yungblud and Travis Barker. His first release in the genre, the song was nominated at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards,[124] and was certified platinum within a year.[125] On July 12, 2019, Cold Hart and Yawns of the influential emo rap collective GothBoiClique, released the pop-punk album Good Morning Cruel World,[126] and on September 18, 2019, emo rapper Lil Tracy released the pop-punk song ""Beautiful Nightmare"".[127]

An October 2019 article by Mic cited emo rap as bringing an interest to a new wave of pop-punk groups like Stand Atlantic, Doll Skin, Waterparks and rapper Vic Mensa's band 93PUNX.[128] Alternative Press also cited English bands Trash Boat, Boston Manor and As It Is as making ""significant contributions to the latest revival era"".[129]

In September 2020, Machine Gun Kelly released his fifth studio album Tickets To My Downfall, his first entirely pop-punk album. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first rock album to top the chart since Tool's Fear Inoculum in September 2019.[130] The Evening Standard credited the album as ""bridg[ing] the gap"" between the modern pop punk scene and the mainstream interest that developed from the emo rap scene.[124] ""My Ex's Best Friend"", a song from Tickets to My Downfall, has since peaked at number 21 on Billboard Hot 100. Because of this, a number of media outlets began crediting him with leading a pop-punk revival.[131][132][133]

An article by Kerrang! credited Machine Gun Kelly as well as Yungblud as bringing the genre back to mainstream attention. In addition to this, the publication cited the app TikTok as one of the key factors, as videos tagged #poppunk had received 400 million views by January 21, 2021. On the app, viral trends took place using tracks from pop-punk bands like All Time Low, Simple Plan and Paramore.[134] Some popular TikTok content creators even began releasing music in the genre around this time. Notably, TikToker Jxdn began releasing pop-punk music in February 2020,[135] while LilHuddy did the same the following year.[136] This led Polygon to term this new wave of artists ""TikTokcore"".[137]Spin writer Al Shipley described pop-punk and its new association with hip hop as 2020's ""commercial juggernaut"".[138]

Our Culture Mag cited KennyHoopla as a ""key player in the [return] of the genre"",[139] and Kerrang! called him the ""leader of pop punk's new generation"".[140]Olivia Rodrigo's 2021 pop-punk song ""Good 4 U"" peaked at number one on the Billboard singles chart,[141] which according to Slate magazine, made it ""rock's first hot 100 number 1 in years"".[142] Publications such as the Face, the Independent and USA Today cited this wave as having an increased diversity of sexuality, race and gender when compared to prior eras.[143][144][145] A February 2021 article by Louder Sound cited artists like Meet Me at the Altar, Yours Truly, Noah Finnce and Jxdn as ""reinventing pop-punk for 2021"".[146]

In 2023, Cassadee Pope (from the defunct band Hey Monday) announced that she was stepping away from country music and going back to her roots in pop-punk, with the release of the singles ""People That I Love Leave"", ""Almost There"", and ""Coma"" (featuring Taylor Acorn).[147][148] In August 2023, Rodrigo released the song ""Bad Idea Right?"", which features pop-punk and indie rock influences, from her second studio album Guts. The song peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs Chart.[149]

Emo pop became popular in the mid-2000s, with record labels such as Fueled by Ramen releasing platinum albums from bands including My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Paramore.[150] Maloney wrote: ""While many pop punk fans adamantly deny any association between their favorite acts and those labeled ""emo,"" crossover bands who melded the two have gradually put both genres in the same scene-boat.""[91]

Easycore (less commonly known as popcore, dudecore, softcore, happy hardcore, and EZ)[151] is a genre that merges pop-punk with elements of metalcore.[152]
It often makes use of breakdowns, screamed vocals, major key progressions and riffs and synthesizers. The genre's roots come from early 2000s pop-punk groups Sum 41 and New Found Glory. New Found Glory's self-titled and Stick and Stones albums and Sum 41's song ""Fat Lip"" were some of the earliest and most influential released in the genre. The style's name originates from the 2008 ""Easycore tour"", which featured A Day to Remember, Four Year Strong and headliners New Found Glory, which itself was a pun based on the name of ""hardcore punk"".[151]

Neon pop-punk (also known as simply neon pop)[153] is a form of pop-punk that emphasizes synthesizers.[154]Alternative Press writer Tyler Sharp wrote that while this wasn't the first instance that ""a band decided to put fuzzy keys over their chord progressions, but it was a time when that formula was perfected.""[154] Kika Chatterjee of Alternative Press added that the late 2000s ""brought in glowing synths and poppy melodies that shifted the entire definition of [pop punk]"", giving it the ""neon"" moniker.[155] Sharp cited Forever the Sickest Kids' debut album Underdog Alma Mater (2008) as ""a big moment"" for the genre.[156]

The punk rock music community often perceived pop-punk to be, according to Iain Ellis of PopMatters, ""too soft, too fake, too derivative, and too corporate"".[157] In a 2003 interview, Buzzcocks guitarist Steve Diggle would suggest that punk had become a ""huge umbrella"", stating, ""And fair play to bands like Green Day and stuff, you know, they've been inspired when they were really young by us and the Clash and things, but it comes from a different well. When we started, punk to me was the Clash, the [Sex] Pistols, and the Buzzcocks over here [the United Kingdom], and in the [United] States it was the Dolls, Iggy, and the Ramones. We invented our style, just like the Clash did and the Ramones did. But the bands that have come later, some of them you see tend to just ape what went on before, where I'd rather them do their own thing a bit more with it.""[158]

Green Day were accused of selling out since the release of Dookie for signing to a major label and becoming mainstream.[159] John Lydon of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols criticized Green Day and said that Green Day are not a punk band. Lydon said: ""Don't try and tell me Green Day are punk. They're not, they're plonk and they're bandwagoning on something they didn't come up with themselves. I think they are phony.""[160] Green Day guitarist and lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong said: ""Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'""[159]

Blink-182 also received a lot of criticism from punk rock fans, being accused of selling out for their pop-music-inspired style of pop-punk. Lydon called Blink-182 ""bunch of silly boys ... an imitation of a comedy act.""[161] Blink-182 guitarist and singer Tom DeLonge responded to criticism, saying: ""I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion Maximumrocknroll and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it's so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views.""[162]

In a November 2004 interview, Sum 41 rhythm guitarist and lead singer Deryck Whibley said: ""We don't even consider ourselves punk. We're just a rock band. We want to do something different. We want to do our own thing. That's how music has always been to us.""[163] Sum 41's lead guitarist Dave Baksh reiterated Whibley's claims, stating ""We just call ourselves rock... It's easier to say than punk, especially around all these fuckin' kids that think they know what punk is. Something that was based on not having any rules has probably been one of the strictest fucking rule books in the world.""[164]

Music critic for Treblezine Jeff Terich argued that the debate regarded the ethics of ""pop-punk"" is redundant, saying that there is ""no discussion of the genre that doesn't eventually devolve into the black-mold-like growth of Disney-approved mallrats, but the irony of it is that all punk is pop. The Ramones? Pop. The Clash? Pop. And The Buzzcocks? Damn right they're pop.""[165]"
"Yacht rock","

Yacht rock (originally known as the West Coast sound[4][5] or adult-oriented rock[6]) is a broad music style and aesthetic[7] commonly associated with soft rock,[8] one of the most commercially successful genres from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. Drawing on sources such as smooth soul, smooth jazz,[1]R&B, and disco,[7] common stylistic traits include high-quality production, clean vocals, and a focus on light, catchy melodies.[6] The term yacht rock was coined in 2005 by the makers of the online video series Yacht Rock, who connected the music with the popular Southern Californian leisure activity of boating. It was considered a pejorative term by some music critics.[6] Prominent artists that have been labeled ""yacht rock"" include Ambrosia, England Dan & John Ford Coley, Christopher Cross, The Doobie Brothers, Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan, Rupert Holmes, Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins, Toto, and Supertramp.

The term yacht rock did not exist contemporaneously with the music the term describes,[6] which was produced from 1975 to 1984.[7][8] It refers to ""adult-oriented rock""[6] or ""West Coast Sound"",[4][3] which became identified with yacht rock in 2005, when the term was coined in J. D. Ryznar et al.'s online video series of the same name.[9][10][11] Understood as a pejorative term,[6]yacht rock referred, in part, to a stereotypical yuppie yacht owner enjoying smooth music while sailing. Many ""yacht rockers"" included nautical references in their lyrics, videos, and album artwork, exemplified by Christopher Cross's anthemic track, ""Sailing"" (1979).[12] Long mocked for ""its saccharine sincerity and garish fashion,"" the original stigma attached to the music has lessened since about 2015.[6][3]

In 2014, AllMusic's Matt Colier identified the ""key defining rules of the genre:""

The ""exhilaration of escape"" is ""essential to yacht,"" according to journalist and documentary-film maker Katie Puckrik. She quoted the lyrics of Cross's ""Ride Like the Wind"" (1979), ""to make it to the border of Mexico,"" as an example of the aspirational longing that demonstrates ""the power of the genre."" Thwarted desire is another key element that counters the ""feelgood bounce"" of yacht in the same song. Puckrik identified a sub-genre, ""dark yacht"", exemplified in Joni Mitchell's ""accidental yacht rock"" song ""The Hissing of Summer Lawns"" (1975), which described the ""tarnished love"" of ""a woman trapped in a big house and a loveless marriage.""[13]

According to Mara Schwartz Kuge, who worked in the L.A. music industry for two decades, ""Soft rock was a genre of very popular pop music from the 1970s and early 1980s, characterized by soft, mostly acoustic guitars and slow-to-mid tempos ... most people have generalized the term to mean anything kind of soft-and-1970s-ish, including artists like Rupert Holmes. Not all yacht rock is soft, either: Toto's 'Hold the Line' and Kenny Loggins' 'Footloose' are both very yacht rock but not soft rock.""[14]

Comprehensively defining yacht rock remains difficult, despite agreement that its central elements are ""aspirational but not luxurious, jaunty but lonely, pained but polished."" Journalist Jack Seale stated that, as in other ""micro-genres"", certain albums of artists who are accepted as proponents are ""arbitrarily ruled in or out"". For example, Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) is accepted as yacht rock, but Fleetwood Mac's Rumours (1977) is not.[15]

Yacht Rock web series co-creators Ryznar, Steve Huey, Hunter Stair, and David Lyons have attempted to apply precision to what is defined as yacht rock, and have been critical of overly expansive definitions of the term. In 2016, they invented the term ""nyacht rock"" to refer to songs that have sometimes been classified as yacht rock but that they felt did not fit the definition.[16][17] On their podcasts Beyond Yacht Rock and Yacht or Nyacht?, they have categorized various songs as being either within or outside of the genre.[18]

Factors that the four list as relevant to yacht rock include:

Ryznar and company have argued that many artists sometimes associated with yacht rock, particularly the folk-driven soft rock of Gordon Lightfoot and the Eagles, fall outside the scope of the term as originally conceived.[5] They have also disputed the use of the term as an umbrella for any song whose lyrics include nautical references.[5][17]

The socio-political and economic changes that contributed to the emergence of the genre[20] have recently been described by journalists like Steven Orlofsky, and by documentary-film maker Katie Puckrik. Orlofsky pointed out that some contemporaneous pop groups such as Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan, and Supertramp were well-respected by critics and listeners.[21] Yacht rock was art ""untouched by the outside world."" By contrast to what followed, it ""was probably the last major era of pop music wholly separated from the politics of its day.""[3] Yacht rock represented an ""introspective individualism"" that emerged after the death of the ""mass-movement idealism"" of the 1960s. Its ""reassuringly vague escapism"" was boosted by the rise of FM radio which brought together two consequences of gender emancipation: women who controlled household spending and men who ""felt freer to convey their emotions in song.""[15]

The roots of yacht rock can be traced to the music of the Beach Boys, whose aesthetic was the first to be ""scavenged"" by acts like Rupert Holmes, according to Jacobin's Dan O'Sullivan. Captain & Tennille, who were members of the Beach Boys' live band, won ""yacht rock's first Best Record Grammy"" in 1975, for ""Love Will Keep Us Together"", a song that composer Neil Sedaka acknowledged was inspired in part by a Beach Boys riff.[23] O'Sullivan also cites the Beach Boys recording of ""Sloop John B"" (1966) as the origin of yacht rock's predilection for the ""sailors and beachgoers"" aesthetic that was ""lifted by everyone, from Christopher Cross to Eric Carmen, from 'Buffalo Springfield' folksters like Jim Messina to 'Philly Sound' rockers like Hall & Oates.""[24]

Some of the most popular yacht rock acts (who also collaborated on each other's records) included Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins, Steely Dan, and Toto.[12][25][26][27]

Recent positive reappraisals of the genre have appeared in The Guardian,[28]The Week,[3] and on BBC Four, which broadcast Puckrik's two-part documentary, I Can Go for That: The Smooth World of Yacht Rock, in June 2019.[15][29] (That documentary is a play on the 1981 Hall & Oates song ""I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)"".)[13]

Orlofsky has argued that the genre's resurgence is partly due to its function as an antidote to the negativity of the post-Obama era in the US just as in its original context, when yacht rock created ""the perfect soundtrack for listeners trying to ignore Watergate and Vietnam,""[15] it now again represents ""a defiant, fingers-planted-firmly-within-ears disregard of any and all political unrest.""[3]

New yacht rock bands such as Young Gun Silver Fox have garnered popularity and media recognition in recent years. Glide magazine describes Young Gun Silver Fox's album AM Waves as having ""its brand of 70’s SoCal-infused pop rock"" and compares it to the likes of other yacht rock bands such as Ambrosia and the Doobie Brothers.[30] S. Victor Aaron of Something Else! reviews described their Rolling Back album as ""as another fine example of the neo-yacht rock that YGSF has absolutely mastered.""[31] While Something Else! reviews consider Young Gun Silver Fox to fall under the category of ""neo-yacht rock"", Talia Woodridge of The Spill Magazine classifies Young Gun Silver as a yacht rock band.[32]

A 2012 Jacobin article described yacht rock as ""endlessly banal, melodic and inoffensive, fit to be piped into Macy's changing rooms.""[33] The article describes the popularity of yacht rock as reflective of a regressive Reagan-era American society and ""about the garden of nightmares America had become."" According to the Jacobin article, yacht rock served as ""an escape from blunt truths"" about sociopolitical issues of the day. In an article in The New Inquiry, music scholar J. Temperance stated that yacht rock ""sterilized the form of its soul and blues elements and instead emphasized disinterested, intentionally trite lyrical themes.""[34] In a uDiscovermusic article, Paul Sexton expressed how yacht rock as a genre seemed to ""exude privileged opulence: of days in expensive recording studios followed by hedonistic trips on private yachts.""[35]  According to writer Max McKenna in a 2018 Popmatters article, the lack of political messaging in the yacht rock genre is a ""conservative gesture(s) flying under the radar in a climate of poptimist reappraisal.""[36]

In response to the Jacobin article, music scholar J. Temperance wrote in The New Inquiry that, rather than being a reactionary genre, yacht rock was essential to the growth of pop music in a time of ""cultural darkness"", ""serving as a dialectical pole to progressive rock as well as to punk, postpunk and even proto-postpunk, spurring drastic retrenchments.""[34] J. Temperance attributed the ""smooth"" sound that is characteristic of yacht rock to an indifferent approach to capitalist culture and a ""regressive tolerance of allegedly transgressive music with a truly liberatory anality"" by using existing symbols rather than create new anti-establishment symbols that are eventually added into the establishment symbols. The New Inquiry article describes the role of yacht rock as a genre that would help people differentiate music appreciation from status by using common symbols and ""rendering the popular into the smooth.""[34]

Yacht rock had also faced racial criticism, given the genre's associations with ""the revival of white rock forms"" as writer Max McKenna stated in the 2018 Popmatters article.[36]Wesley Morris compares in a New York Times op-ed piece the recognition given to black artists and white artists who possess the ""absurd"" quality of blackness in their music.[37] Due to its perceived lack of political involvement and borrowed elements from black music genres, yacht rock has garnered the perception of racial ignorance amongst certain critics of the genre.[37] The Jacobin article described Michael McDonald, a musician well known within the genre of yacht rock, as a ""bleached, blue-eyed soul cracker.""[33]

Yacht rock is listed as a genre on Spotify, Amazon Music, AccuRadio, and Pandora. Since 2015, there has been a ""Yacht Rock"" channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  The channel reverts to the off-season channel after summer,[38] but is available year-round on the SXM app. iHeartRadio also has a dedicated ""Yacht Rock Radio"" station that airs this format 24/7 on its website and app.[39]

Twenty-first century musicians have formed cover bands centered on the yacht rock idea, such as Yachtley Crew and Yacht Rock Revue, which have done national tours.[40][41] Yacht Rock Revue hosts an annual Yacht Rock Revival concert where they invite members of the original bands they cover to join them on stage for a few songs, including Walter Egan, Robbie Dupree, Peter Beckett (Player), Bobby Kimball (former lead singer of Toto), Jeff Carlisi (.38 Special), Bill Champlin (Chicago), and Denny Laine (Wings).[41]

In 2018, Jawbone Press released The Yacht Rock Book: The Oral History of the Soft, Smooth Sounds of the 70s and 80s by author Greg Prato, which explored the entire history of the genre.[42] The book featured a foreword by Fred Armisen, and interviews with Christopher Cross, Kenny Loggins, and John Oates, among others.[17]

Yacht rock bears strong similarities to the Japanese genre of city pop in that they both peaked in the early 1980s, featured jazz and R&B influences arranged and produced by elites in their fields, and gained newfound popularity in the 2010s through the Internet. The link between city pop and yacht rock was made explicit in 1984 when Tatsuro Yamashita, one of Japan's most influential city pop artists and producers, traveled to California to record the album Big Wave, a mix of Beach Boys covers and original English-language compositions written in collaboration with Alan O'Day.

Yacht rock had some influence on the creation of progressive rock, punk rock, postpunk, and proto-postpunk.[34]

Elements of yacht rock have been adopted by new acts such as Vampire Weekend, Foxygen, and Carly Rae Jepsen, while the vaporwave genre of electronic music, which began in the 2010s, appropriated the ""nautical iconography"" of yacht rock.

The 2017 album by Thundercat, Drunk, featured a song that included guest vocalists Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald, entitled ""Show You the Way"" (all performed the song together on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the same year).

The band Sugar Ray's 2019 album Little Yachty is a conscious homage to yacht rock; it includes a cover of the 1979 Rupert Holmes song ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"", which lead singer Mark McGrath has called ""the torch bearer of all things yacht rock."""
"Soul music","

Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African-American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.[2] It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues.[3] Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.[4] It also had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre neo-soul,[5] which added modern production elements and influence from hip-hop.

Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound.[6] The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds.[6] Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The newfound African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black,[7] and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry.[8] Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.[9]

Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.[10] Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group the Temptations.[11] By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.

The key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds;[12]Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; and psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music.

Soul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term ""soul"" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.[13]  According to musicologist Barry Hansen,[14]

Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style.

According to AllMusic, ""Soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s.""[16] The phrase ""soul music"" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961.[17] The term ""soul"" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for African-American popular music at the time.[18][19]

According to the Acoustic Music organization, the ""first clear evidence of soul music shows up with the ""5"" Royales, an ex-gospel group that turned to R&B and in Faye Adams, whose ""Shake A Hand"" becomes an R&B standard"".[20]

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James.[14]Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's ""I Got a Woman"".[21] Singer Bobby Womack said, ""Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music.""[10] Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.

Little Richard, who inspired Otis Redding,[22] and James Brown both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the ""Godfather of Soul Music"",[15] and Richard proclaimed himself as the ""King of Rockin' and Rollin', Rhythm and Blues Soulin'"", because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.[23]

Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.[10][24] Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of ""You Send Me"" in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of ""Bring It On Home To Me"" has been described as ""perhaps the first record to define the soul experience"".[25] Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit ""Reet Petite"".[26] He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.[27]

Husband-wife duo Ike & Tina Turner emerged as ""leading exponents"" of soul music in the 1960s.[28][29] Their debut single ""A Fool in Love"" crossed over to the pop charts in 1960. They earned a Grammy nomination for their song ""It's Gonna Work Out Fine"" in 1962.[30] Along with the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes, they toured the Chitlin Circuit as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.[31]

Writer Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including ""Cry to Me"", ""Just Out of Reach"" and ""Down in the Valley"" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote:

Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's ""Just Out Of Reach"". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein.  Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement.[32]

Ben E. King also achieved success in 1961 with ""Stand By Me"", a song directly based on a gospel hymn.[10] By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King, and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  According to Jon Landau:

Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home... He soon became known as ""Mr. Pitiful"" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads.[33]

The most important female soul singer to emerge was Aretha Franklin, originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalized by her recordings for Atlantic.  Her 1967 recordings, such as ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"", ""Respect"" (written and originally recorded by Otis Redding), and ""Do Right Woman, Do Right Man"" (written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn), were significant and commercially successful productions.[34][35][36][37]

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S.  Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.[10] The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. ""Soul"" became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to ""deep soul"" performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr.[38][39][40] Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.[16][41]

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into different subgenres.  Artists such as James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.[10] However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.[16]

Mitchell's Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson.[42]Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.[43][44]

In Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and the Dramatics.[45] Early 1970s recordings by the Detroit Emeralds, such as Do Me Right, are a link between soul and the later disco style.[46]Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr.[38] Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.[47]

By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres.[48] Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and the Meters.[49] More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time.[50] During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or ""city-soul"" groups such as the Delfonics and the historically black Howard University's Unifics.[51][52]

The syndicated music/dance variety television series Soul Train, hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971.[53] The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by the Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar.[54] Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s.[54] The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.[55]

As disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, the Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Khan, and Larry Graham.

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style is known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994.

Berry Gordy's successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Miracles, the Four Tops, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Martha and the Vandellas,[56] and the Jackson Five.

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial ""production-line"" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland were rarely out of the charts for their work as songwriters and record producers for the Supremes, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas.[56] They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. The rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or tambourine. Smokey Robinson was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to ""The Tracks of My Tears"" by his group the Miracles, which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well-known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.[57][page needed]Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and many more.[58] Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded Atlantic Records in 1947 with his friend Herb Abramson. Ertegun wrote many songs for Ray Charles and the Clovers. He even sang backup vocals for his artist Big Joe Turner on the song, ""Shake Rattle and Roll"".[59]

Dominated by Berry Gordy's Motown Records empire, Detroit's soul is strongly rhythmic and influenced by gospel music. The Motown sound often includes hand clapping, a powerful bassline, strings, brass and vibraphone. Motown Records' house band was the Funk Brothers. AllMusic cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and crossover success.[60] Artists of this style included Diana Ross, the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and Billy Preston.[60] Popular during the 1960s, the style became glossier during the 1970s and led to disco.[60] In the late 2000s, the style was revisited by contemporary soul singers such as Amy Winehouse,[61]Raphael Saadiq (specifically his 2008 album The Way I See It) and Solange Knowles (her 2008 album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams).[62]

The terms deep soul and southern soul generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining R&B's energy with pulsating southern United States gospel music sounds. Memphis, Tennessee, label Stax Records nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands Booker T & the MGs (with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and Al Jackson) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the Mar-Keys, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love).

Memphis soul is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, Hammond organ, bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's Al Green and Stax's Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged Southern soul style. The Hi Records house band (Hi Rhythm Section) and producer Willie Mitchell developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style but had their own unique sound.

The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Huey Piano Smith made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of Funk music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was a songwriter, arranger, and producer Allen Toussaint.  He worked with such artists as Irma Thomas (""the Soul Queen of New Orleans""), Jessie Hill, Chris Kenner, Benny Spellman, and Ernie K-Doe on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, Betty Harris, and Aaron Neville. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City and Los Angeles–based record labels—notably Lee Dorsey for New York-based Amy Records and the Meters for New York–based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. Vee Jay Records, which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by Jerry Butler, Betty Everett, Dee Clark, and Gene Chandler. Chess Records, mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced several major soul artists, including the Dells and Billy Stewart. Curtis Mayfield not only scored many hits with his group, the Impressions, but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for the Fascinations, Major Lance, and the Five Stairsteps.

Based primarily in the Philadelphia International record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush string and horn arrangements and doo-wop-inspired vocals. Thom Bell, and Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for Patti LaBelle, the O'Jays, the Intruders, the Three Degrees, the Delfonics, the Stylistics, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and the Spinners.

By the 1970s, African-American popular musicians had drawn from the conceptual album-oriented approach of the then-burgeoning progressive rock development. This progressive-soul development inspired a newfound sophisticated musicality and ambitious lyricism in black pop.[63] Among these musicians were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton.[64] In discussing the progressive soul of the 1970s, Martin cites this period's albums from Wonder (Talking Book, Innervisions, Songs in the Key of Life), War (All Day Music, The World Is a Ghetto, War Live), and the Isley Brothers (3 + 3).[65]Isaac Hayes's 1969 recording of ""Walk on By"" is considered a ""classic"" of prog-soul, according to City Pages journalist Jay Boller.[66] Later prog-soul music includes recordings by Prince,[67]Peter Gabriel,[68]Meshell Ndegeocello, Joi,[69]Bilal, Dwele, Anthony David,[70]Janelle Monáe,[71] and the Soulquarians, an experimental black-music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.[72]

Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as ""black rock"", was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later.[73] Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes.[74] While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.[75][failed verification]

In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market.[76] Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.[77] There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.[78] In the 1970s Carl Douglas, the Real Thing and Delegation[79] had hits in the UK. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the mod, Northern soul and modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when several artists including George Michael, Sade, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul enjoyed commercial success.[80] The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably Amy Winehouse, Adele, Estelle, Duffy, Joss Stone and Leona Lewis, led to talk of a ""Third British Invasion"" or ""British Soul Invasion"" in the 2000s and 2010s.[81][82]

Neo soul is a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with contemporary R&B sounds, hip-hop beats, and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s, and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and record label executive Kedar Massenburg. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano ""pads"" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.

Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British mod subculture in Northern England and the English Midlands, based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase northern soul was coined by a journalist Dave Godin and popularised through his column in Blues and Soul magazine.[83]   The rare soul records were played by DJs at nightclubs, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown and smaller labels, not necessarily from the Northern United States.

Many artists in various genres of electronic music (such as house, drum n bass, UK garage, and downtempo) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.

The impact of soul music was manifold; internationally, white and other non-black musicians were influenced by soul music. British soul and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England, are examples.

Several terms were introduced, such as ""blue-eyed soul"", which is R&B or soul music performed by white artists. The meaning of blue-eyed soul has evolved over the decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by Motown Records and Stax Records.[34] The Righteous Brothers, the Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison & Them, and the Grass Roots were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in the 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music. Artists like Hall & Oates, David Bowie, Teena Marie, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, Frankie Valli, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse and Adele are known as blue-eyed soul singers.

Another term is brown-eyed soul, or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by Latinos in Southern California during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.[84][85] The genre of soul music occasionally draws from Latin, and often contains rock music influences.[86] This contrasts with blue-eyed soul, soul music performed by non-Hispanic white artists.[87]Ritchie Valens, one of the original pioneers of brown-eyed soul music, also became one of the first brown-eyed soul artists to bring traditional Latin music and rock and roll influences into the genre. Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the funk-influenced Philadelphia soul, or ""Philly"" soul. The West Coast Latin rock scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as Cannibal & the Headhunters (""Land of a Thousand Dances"") and Thee Midniters played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious rock and roll edge. Many of these artists drew from the frat rock and garage rock scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were ""some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late 1960s and 1970s.""[84]"
"Sunshine pop","Sunshine pop (originally known as soft pop) is a subgenre of pop music that originated in Southern California in the mid-1960s. Rooted in easy listening and advertising jingles, sunshine pop acts combined nostalgic or anxious moods with ""an appreciation for the beauty of the world"".[1] The category largely consists of lesser-known artists who imitated more popular groups such as the Mamas & the Papas and the 5th Dimension. While the Beach Boys are noted as prominent influences, the band's music was rarely representative of the genre.[1][2]

Sunshine pop enjoyed mainstream success in the latter half of the decade, with many of its top 40 hits peaking in the spring and summer of 1967, especially just before the Summer of Love. Popular acts include the Turtles and the Association. Other groups, like the Millennium, Sagittarius, and the Yellow Balloon were less successful but gained a cult following years later[4] with albums like Begin (Millennium, 1968) and Present Tense (Sagittarius, 1968) being sought on the collectors’ market.[1]

Music identified under the sunshine pop banner initially was called ""soft pop"".[3] Record collectors coined and popularized the term ""sunshine pop"" many years after the fact.[8][5]

Sunshine pop originated in California in the mid to late-1960s,[4] beginning as an outgrowth of the California Sound[3] and folk rock movements.[5] Rooted in easy-listening, advertising jingles, and the growing drug culture,[1] the music was characterized by lush vocals and light arrangements similar to samba music.[2] Most of the acts were lesser-known bands named after fruits, colors, or cosmic concepts[1] that imitated popular groups like the Beach Boys, the Mamas & the Papas, and the 5th Dimension.[8] In some ways, the genre is similar to baroque pop through being elaborate and melancholic, but it crossed into folk-pop and Brill Building styles.[4] It may be seen as a form of escapism from the turmoil of the times.[9]The A.V. Club's Noel Murray writes: ""sunshine pop acts expressed an appreciation for the beauty of the world mixed with a sense of anxiety that the good ol' days were gone for good.""[1]

Some of the artists who influenced the style include Curt Boettcher, the Mamas & the Papas' John Phillips, and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. Concerning the Beach Boys' involvement with sunshine pop, the orchestral style of Pet Sounds (1966) was imitated by many Los Angeles record producers, but The A.V. Club notes: ""Though [the Beach Boys] ... were hugely influential on the sunshine pop acts that followed, [their] music was rarely in step with the genre.""[1]The Suburban's Joel Goldenburg believes the closest the group ever came to the genre was the lightly produced album Friends (1968): ""the vocals of sunshine pop songs are a little more anonymous and not as lushly featured as that of The Beach Boys. And I don't see the [Phil] Spector connection. The light touch applied to the songs reminds me more of soft samba music.""[2] Murray says that ""John Phillips, on the other hand, practically created the blueprint for sunshine pop, with little of Wilson's uncommercial weirdness.""[1] Brian Wilson commented that ""you can turn the Beach Boys upside down ... just the track or whatever, and I think they [the Mamas & the Papas] have as much vocal as we do track ... whereas, I think, we emphasize a little more track than vocal.""[10]

Sunshine pop and the California Sound's influence expanded to other countries. In Spain, it initially was pioneered by groups like Pic-Nic, Granada Los Ángeles and Los Iberos in 1968.[11] Between 1969 and the 1970s there was a boom of ""soft pop"" acts in the country, among them Los Yetis, Solera, Módulos, Nuevos Horizontes and Vainica Doble.[11]

After its peak in the 1960s, the genre lingered in near-obscurity, although it enjoyed some interest among collectors of rare vinyl singles and LPs. Select albums would occasionally fetch hefty prices at online auctions or in record stores.[12] A name was eventually given to the music, ""sunshine pop"", although it was rarely deployed outside of record collecting circles.[5] In the early 1990s, a renewed interest began in Japan,[13] where record companies started publishing compilations of long-forgotten, obscure 1960s music. This revival subsequently spread to Europe and the United States.[14]

Compilations and box-sets by groups such as Spanky and Our Gang, The Association, The Arbors and The Love Generation have been released on CD. Among the record labels which issue sunshine pop re-releases are Revola Records in Britain and the US label Sundazed."
"Teen pop","Teen pop is a subgenre of pop music that is created, marketed and oriented towards preteens and teenagers.[1][7] Often, the artists themselves are teenagers during their breakout. While it can involve influences from a wide array of musical genres, it remains a subset of commercial pop, focusing on catchy melodies and marketability.[7] Teen pop’s lyrics emphasize themes that teenagers can relate to, such as love, growing up, or partying.[4] The image of the artist as an aspirational or desirable teenage figure is a crucial element of the genre, highlighting their visual appeal.[8]

Despite facing criticism for being perceived as inauthentic or overly commercial, teen pop has remained a defining genre in the music industry. Today, it continues to dominate commercial markets with artists such as Olivia Rodrigo and Tate McRae. The genre's popularity can be attributed to teenagers' disposable income, which they often devote to purchasing singles, albums, and merchandise. The impact of the teen pop genre extends beyond the music industry into culture, influencing fashion, language, and social trends.[9]  Teenage fans often develop a parasocial relationship with their idols, believing that the artist cares about them and their fellow fans.[8] The intense connection between teen pop artists and their young audiences has had a profound effect on the psychological nature of teenagers, shaping their self-image and cultural identity.[10]

Structurally, teen pop may include influences from a variety of other genres, such as R&B, rock, electronic, or hip hop.[1][2] Usually, it includes catchy repeated chorus lines,[11]Auto-Tuned or pitch-corrected vocals, and upbeat melodies.[4]

Appealing to adolescents, the lyrical content of teen pop usually involves themes teenagers can or aspire to relate to, such as young love, partying, high school social hierarchies, and often incorporate sexual inneundo.[12] An element of visual appeal is integral to teen pop, with teen idols usually being an object of desire or aspiration to their fans, often by cultivating an image of being a girl/boy next door.[13] Stylish fashion, popular hairstyles, and choreographed dance crazes are important commercial elements of teen pop.[8]

According to AllMusic, teen pop ""is essentially dance-pop, pop, and urban ballads"" that are marketed to teens, and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s, pointing out the late 1990s as ""arguably the style's golden era.""[1]About.com's Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as ""a simple, straightforward, ultra-catchy melody line [...] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres, but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop. The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners.""[7]

In Crazy About You: Reflections on the Meanings of Contemporary Teen Pop Music (2002), Phillip Vannini and Scott M. Myers write that teen pop songs ""are targeted to youths presumably unaware and unconcerned with the problems of everyday society. Youths are symbolized as mainly in growing up while having a good time.""[10] Some authors deemed teen pop music as ""more disposable, less intellectually challenging, more feminine, simpler and more commercially focused than other musical forms.""[4] In Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual, author Melanie Lowe wrote that teen pop ""is marked by a clash of presumed innocence and overt sexuality, a conflict that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil of its primary target audience and vital fan base: early-adolescent middle-and upper middle-class suburban girls.""[14]

Teen pop has a rich and evolving history that extends beyond its commercial success. [15] Characterized by its simple, catchy melodies and mainstream appeal, teen pop has been a staple of the Music industry since the 1940s, with artists like teen idol Frank Sinatra paving the way. However, it wasn't until the late 1980s and early 1990s that the genre experienced a significant resurgence, coinciding with the widespread use of the term ""Teen Pop"" to describe this particular style of music.

[15] This revival came after a period of decline in the late 1970s and early 1980s when teen-oriented pop faded due to the rising popularity of Punk rock and Disco. Disco becoming popular from the United States' city nightlife scene, and punk rock from its lyrics focus on themes of rebellion against Authority and the Establishment.[16][17] Nevertheless, the early 2000s marked a peak in pop dominance, with teen pop becoming even more popular. Artists like Britney Spears became iconic figures, influencing not only music but also fashion trends of the 2000s.[18]

Teen-oriented popular music had become common by the end of the swing era, in the late 1940s, with Frank Sinatra being an early teen idol.[4] However, it was the early 1960s that became known as the ""golden age"" for pop teen idols, who included Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Lulu and Ricky Nelson.[7] During the 1970s, one of the most popular preteen and teen-oriented acts was the Osmonds,[7] where family members Donny and Marie both enjoyed individual success as well as success as a duo apart from the main family (Donny also recorded with his brothers as the Osmonds).

The first major wave of teen pop after the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s occurred in the mid to late 1980s, with artists such as Menudo, New Edition, the Jets, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Martika, New Kids on the Block[1][7] and Kylie Minogue.[19] In the early 1990s, teen pop dominated the charts until grunge and gangsta rap crossed over into the mainstream in North America by late 1991. Teen pop remained popular in the United Kingdom with the boy band Take That during this period, until the mid-1990s when Britpop became the next major wave in the UK, eclipsing the style similar to how grunge did in North America.[1]

In 1996, British girl group Spice Girls released their debut single ""Wannabe"", which made them major pop stars in the UK, as well as in the US the following year. In their wake, other teen pop groups and singers rose to prominence, including Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Robyn, All Saints, S Club 7, Five, B*Witched, and Destiny's Child.[1][7] In 1999, the success of teenaged pop singers Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore marked the development of what AllMusic refers to as the ""pop Lolita"" trend,[1][7] sparking the short careers of upcoming pop singers such as Willa Ford, Brooke Allison, Samantha Mumba, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mikaila, Amanda, Nikki Cleary and Kaci Battaglia. 
In 2001, artists like Aaron Carter, Swedish group A-Teens, girl groups 3LW, Play, Eden's Crush and Dream and boy bands O-Town, B2K and Dream Street were teen pop artists who achieved success. In Latin America, successful singers and bands appealing to tweens and teens were Sandy & Junior,[20]RBD[21] and Rouge.[22]
According to Gayle Ward, the demise of this late 1990s teen pop was due to:

1990s and early 2000s teen pop artists eventually entered hiatuses and semi-retirements (*NSYNC, Dream, Destiny's Child) or changed their musical style, including the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, 3LW and Aaron Carter.[7] Many teen artists starting incorporating genres such as pop rock, contemporary R&B and hip-hop. B2K were a hip hop/pop/R&B group consisting of four teenage black boys, and were considered a boy band, though they were only active from 2000 to 2004. Their style of music was very different from other teenage artists, sounding more mature than the typical boy band, though all members were in their mid-teenage years at the time.

In the mid to late 2000s, teenage singers such as Rihanna and Chris Brown achieved success, indicating new relevance of teen-oriented pop music.[7]

In 2005, AKB48 was created to promote idol culture and Japanese pop nationwide and overseas followed by the expansion of sister groups and rival groups locally and internationally over the years. In 2016, SNH48, as AKB48's second international sister group, announced its local Chinese sister groups like BEJ48, GNZ48, SHY48 and CKG48 to integrate idol culture with a Chinese twist.

The emergence of Canadian singer Justin Bieber created a renewed interest in teen pop, especially of the traditional male teen idol. With the release of his debut seven-track EP My World on December 5, 2009, he became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[24] Since his debut, Bieber has played a key role in influencing modern popular culture and has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[25][26]

In 2010, the creation of Ark Music Factory helped contribute a new generation of teen pop artists via the Internet, such as Rebecca Black and Jenna Rose, despite major criticism with these artists due to the excessive use of auto-tune. As for Japanese teen pop culture, the category of ""idol"" was playing an important role. Momoiro Clover Z is ranked as number one among female idol groups according to 2013–2017 surveys.[27]

By the late 2010s, K-pop artists such as BTS and Blackpink, attained international stardom in teen pop culture.[28] Having sold over 4.7 million copies, Map of the Soul: 7 by BTS is the all-time best-selling album in South Korea. BTS is the first Asian and non-English-speaking act to be named International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020).[29] The group was featured on Time's international cover as ""Next Generation Leaders"" in 2018 and are recognised as the ""Princes of Pop"".[30]

Other noteworthy artists include Taylor Swift, an influential figure in contemporary teen pop music, emerged onto the scene as a teenage country artist in the mid-2000s and progressively transitioned to mainstream pop. She quickly became one of the most influential and highest-grossing artists of her generation with multiple Grammy Awards, best-selling album sales, and record-breaking hits. On top of her musical achievement, Taylor Swift also has an immense cultural impact as she has been a vocal advocate for artists’ rights within the music industry. By leveraging the power of her commercial success and undefiable fan support, Taylor Swift constructed a solid platform to denounce injustices regarding the value of creative labour in the digital age. She has been especially instrumental in the reform of policies concerning the fair compensation of artists on music streaming services. Taylor Swift is regarded as “not only a highly successful artist but as an emblematic figure whose very success validates the potential of old-industry structures to both challenge and adapt to the demands of a new economic environment.”  [31] Swift continues to push boundaries and redefine the pop landscape in monumental ways.

One Direction, a British-Irish boy band that formed on the UK version of ‘The X Factor’ in 2010 is the most profitable boy band of all time.[32] Composed of members Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, and Zayn Malik. The group swiftly rose to colossal stardom after its debut and eventually became synonymous with the global trend of teen pop culture in the early 2010s, a phenomenon deeply rooted in the age of Twitter.[33] One Direction’s fame ignited a fan frenzy among their predominantly female fan base to a magnitude such that it has been compared to the “Beatlemania” era of the 1960s.[34] Building on the craze of the American boy bands of the 1990s and early 2000s of NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and later the Jonas Brothers,[35] the One Direction teen idols redefined the concept of the boy band and its legitimacy by shedding the image of the manufactured idol and embracing their authenticity.[32] They created a new wave of the boy band genre that directly contributed to the emergence of other artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer.[36] Despite their indefinite hiatus in 2015, One Direction has a cemented place in the annals of pop music history and its members continue to pursue solo music careers.

More recently, a major teen pop artist has dominated the stage. Olivia Rodrigo is a singer song-writer who has dominated the teen pop scene since the 2020s. Emerging as a teenage Disney star, she swiftly transitioned into pop music to draw from her personal experiences to weave narratives of love, heartbreak and self-exploration. Olivia Rodrigo’s rise to fame can be attributed to her prominence on platforms such as TikTok where she became viral after releasing her first single “Driver’s License” in 2021.[37] Jessica Sage Rauchberg even affirms that “TikTok is foundational to Rodrigo’s success”.[37]"

Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African-American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.[2] It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues.[3] Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.[4] It also had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre neo-soul,[5] which added modern production elements and influence from hip-hop.

Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound.[6] The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds.[6] Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The newfound African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black,[7] and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry.[8] Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.[9]

Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.[10] Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group the Temptations.[11] By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.

The key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds;[12]Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; and psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music.

Soul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term ""soul"" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.[13]  According to musicologist Barry Hansen,[14]

Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style.

According to AllMusic, ""Soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s.""[16] The phrase ""soul music"" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961.[17] The term ""soul"" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for African-American popular music at the time.[18][19]

According to the Acoustic Music organization, the ""first clear evidence of soul music shows up with the ""5"" Royales, an ex-gospel group that turned to R&B and in Faye Adams, whose ""Shake A Hand"" becomes an R&B standard"".[20]

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James.[14]Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's ""I Got a Woman"".[21] Singer Bobby Womack said, ""Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music.""[10] Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.

Little Richard, who inspired Otis Redding,[22] and James Brown both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the ""Godfather of Soul Music"",[15] and Richard proclaimed himself as the ""King of Rockin' and Rollin', Rhythm and Blues Soulin'"", because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.[23]

Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.[10][24] Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of ""You Send Me"" in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of ""Bring It On Home To Me"" has been described as ""perhaps the first record to define the soul experience"".[25] Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit ""Reet Petite"".[26] He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.[27]

Husband-wife duo Ike & Tina Turner emerged as ""leading exponents"" of soul music in the 1960s.[28][29] Their debut single ""A Fool in Love"" crossed over to the pop charts in 1960. They earned a Grammy nomination for their song ""It's Gonna Work Out Fine"" in 1962.[30] Along with the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes, they toured the Chitlin Circuit as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.[31]

Writer Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including ""Cry to Me"", ""Just Out of Reach"" and ""Down in the Valley"" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote:

Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's ""Just Out Of Reach"". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein.  Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement.[32]

Ben E. King also achieved success in 1961 with ""Stand By Me"", a song directly based on a gospel hymn.[10] By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King, and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  According to Jon Landau:

Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home... He soon became known as ""Mr. Pitiful"" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads.[33]

The most important female soul singer to emerge was Aretha Franklin, originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalized by her recordings for Atlantic.  Her 1967 recordings, such as ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"", ""Respect"" (written and originally recorded by Otis Redding), and ""Do Right Woman, Do Right Man"" (written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn), were significant and commercially successful productions.[34][35][36][37]

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S.  Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.[10] The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. ""Soul"" became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to ""deep soul"" performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr.[38][39][40] Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.[16][41]

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into different subgenres.  Artists such as James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.[10] However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.[16]

Mitchell's Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson.[42]Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.[43][44]

In Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and the Dramatics.[45] Early 1970s recordings by the Detroit Emeralds, such as Do Me Right, are a link between soul and the later disco style.[46]Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr.[38] Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.[47]

By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres.[48] Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and the Meters.[49] More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time.[50] During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or ""city-soul"" groups such as the Delfonics and the historically black Howard University's Unifics.[51][52]

The syndicated music/dance variety television series Soul Train, hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971.[53] The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by the Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar.[54] Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s.[54] The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.[55]

As disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, the Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Khan, and Larry Graham.

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style is known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994.

Berry Gordy's successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Miracles, the Four Tops, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Martha and the Vandellas,[56] and the Jackson Five.

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial ""production-line"" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland were rarely out of the charts for their work as songwriters and record producers for the Supremes, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas.[56] They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. The rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or tambourine. Smokey Robinson was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to ""The Tracks of My Tears"" by his group the Miracles, which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well-known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.[57][page needed]Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and many more.[58] Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded Atlantic Records in 1947 with his friend Herb Abramson. Ertegun wrote many songs for Ray Charles and the Clovers. He even sang backup vocals for his artist Big Joe Turner on the song, ""Shake Rattle and Roll"".[59]

Dominated by Berry Gordy's Motown Records empire, Detroit's soul is strongly rhythmic and influenced by gospel music. The Motown sound often includes hand clapping, a powerful bassline, strings, brass and vibraphone. Motown Records' house band was the Funk Brothers. AllMusic cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and crossover success.[60] Artists of this style included Diana Ross, the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and Billy Preston.[60] Popular during the 1960s, the style became glossier during the 1970s and led to disco.[60] In the late 2000s, the style was revisited by contemporary soul singers such as Amy Winehouse,[61]Raphael Saadiq (specifically his 2008 album The Way I See It) and Solange Knowles (her 2008 album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams).[62]

The terms deep soul and southern soul generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining R&B's energy with pulsating southern United States gospel music sounds. Memphis, Tennessee, label Stax Records nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands Booker T & the MGs (with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and Al Jackson) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the Mar-Keys, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love).

Memphis soul is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, Hammond organ, bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's Al Green and Stax's Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged Southern soul style. The Hi Records house band (Hi Rhythm Section) and producer Willie Mitchell developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style but had their own unique sound.

The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Huey Piano Smith made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of Funk music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was a songwriter, arranger, and producer Allen Toussaint.  He worked with such artists as Irma Thomas (""the Soul Queen of New Orleans""), Jessie Hill, Chris Kenner, Benny Spellman, and Ernie K-Doe on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, Betty Harris, and Aaron Neville. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City and Los Angeles–based record labels—notably Lee Dorsey for New York-based Amy Records and the Meters for New York–based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. Vee Jay Records, which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by Jerry Butler, Betty Everett, Dee Clark, and Gene Chandler. Chess Records, mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced several major soul artists, including the Dells and Billy Stewart. Curtis Mayfield not only scored many hits with his group, the Impressions, but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for the Fascinations, Major Lance, and the Five Stairsteps.

Based primarily in the Philadelphia International record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush string and horn arrangements and doo-wop-inspired vocals. Thom Bell, and Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for Patti LaBelle, the O'Jays, the Intruders, the Three Degrees, the Delfonics, the Stylistics, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and the Spinners.

By the 1970s, African-American popular musicians had drawn from the conceptual album-oriented approach of the then-burgeoning progressive rock development. This progressive-soul development inspired a newfound sophisticated musicality and ambitious lyricism in black pop.[63] Among these musicians were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton.[64] In discussing the progressive soul of the 1970s, Martin cites this period's albums from Wonder (Talking Book, Innervisions, Songs in the Key of Life), War (All Day Music, The World Is a Ghetto, War Live), and the Isley Brothers (3 + 3).[65]Isaac Hayes's 1969 recording of ""Walk on By"" is considered a ""classic"" of prog-soul, according to City Pages journalist Jay Boller.[66] Later prog-soul music includes recordings by Prince,[67]Peter Gabriel,[68]Meshell Ndegeocello, Joi,[69]Bilal, Dwele, Anthony David,[70]Janelle Monáe,[71] and the Soulquarians, an experimental black-music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.[72]

Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as ""black rock"", was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later.[73] Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes.[74] While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.[75][failed verification]

In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market.[76] Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.[77] There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.[78] In the 1970s Carl Douglas, the Real Thing and Delegation[79] had hits in the UK. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the mod, Northern soul and modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when several artists including George Michael, Sade, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul enjoyed commercial success.[80] The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably Amy Winehouse, Adele, Estelle, Duffy, Joss Stone and Leona Lewis, led to talk of a ""Third British Invasion"" or ""British Soul Invasion"" in the 2000s and 2010s.[81][82]

Neo soul is a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with contemporary R&B sounds, hip-hop beats, and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s, and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and record label executive Kedar Massenburg. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano ""pads"" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.

Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British mod subculture in Northern England and the English Midlands, based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase northern soul was coined by a journalist Dave Godin and popularised through his column in Blues and Soul magazine.[83]   The rare soul records were played by DJs at nightclubs, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown and smaller labels, not necessarily from the Northern United States.

Many artists in various genres of electronic music (such as house, drum n bass, UK garage, and downtempo) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.

The impact of soul music was manifold; internationally, white and other non-black musicians were influenced by soul music. British soul and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England, are examples.

Several terms were introduced, such as ""blue-eyed soul"", which is R&B or soul music performed by white artists. The meaning of blue-eyed soul has evolved over the decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by Motown Records and Stax Records.[34] The Righteous Brothers, the Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison & Them, and the Grass Roots were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in the 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music. Artists like Hall & Oates, David Bowie, Teena Marie, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, Frankie Valli, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse and Adele are known as blue-eyed soul singers.

Another term is brown-eyed soul, or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by Latinos in Southern California during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.[84][85] The genre of soul music occasionally draws from Latin, and often contains rock music influences.[86] This contrasts with blue-eyed soul, soul music performed by non-Hispanic white artists.[87]Ritchie Valens, one of the original pioneers of brown-eyed soul music, also became one of the first brown-eyed soul artists to bring traditional Latin music and rock and roll influences into the genre. Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the funk-influenced Philadelphia soul, or ""Philly"" soul. The West Coast Latin rock scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as Cannibal & the Headhunters (""Land of a Thousand Dances"") and Thee Midniters played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious rock and roll edge. Many of these artists drew from the frat rock and garage rock scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were ""some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late 1960s and 1970s.""[84]"
"Quiet storm","Quiet storm is a radio format and genre of R&B, performed in a smooth, romantic, jazz-influenced style.[1] It was named after the title song on Smokey Robinson's 1975 album A Quiet Storm.[2]

The radio format was pioneered in 1976 by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the Washington, D.C. radio station WHUR-FM. It eventually became regarded as an identifiable subgenre of R&B.[3] Quiet storm was marketed to primarily upscale mature African-American audiences. It peaked in popularity during the 1980s, but fell out of favor with young listeners in the golden age of hip hop.[4]

Melvin Lindsey, a student at Howard University, with his classmate Jack Shuler, began as disc jockeys for WHUR in June 1976, performing as stand-ins for an absentee employee. Lindsey's on-air voice was silky smooth, and the music selections were initially old, slow romantic songs from black artists of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a form of easy listening which Lindsey called ""beautiful black music"" for African Americans.[5] The response from listeners was positive, and WHUR station manager Cathy Hughes soon gave Lindsey and Shuler their own show. The name of the show came from the Smokey Robinson song ""Quiet Storm"", from his 1975 album A Quiet Storm.

The song developed into Lindsey's theme music which introduced his time slot every night. ""The Quiet Storm"" was four hours of melodically soulful music that provided an intimate, laid-back mood for late-night listening, and that was the key to its tremendous appeal among adult audiences. The format was an immediate success, becoming so popular that within a few years, virtually every station in the U.S. with a core black, urban listenership adopted a similar format for its graveyard slot.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, KBLX-FM expanded the night-time concept into a 24-hour quiet storm format in 1979. In the New York tri-state late night market, Vaughn Harper deejayed the quiet storm graveyard program for WBLS-FM which he developed with co-host Champaine in mid-1983. In 1993, Harper took ill and Champaine continued the program as Quiet Storm II.[6][7]

Following in the footsteps of KBLX, Lawrence Tanter of KUTE in Greater Los Angeles changed his station to an all-day quiet storm format from January 1984 until September 1987, playing ""a hybrid that incorporates pop, jazz, fusion, international, and urban music"". Addressing the misconception that quiet storm was only for blacks, Tanter said his listenership was 40% black, 40% white, and 20% other races.[8]WLNR-FM in Chicago also changed in August 1985 to a 24-hour quiet storm program called ""The Soft Touch"", featuring more instrumental music and even straight-ahead jazz, a mix which sales manager Gregory Brown described as ""not so laid-back"" as other quiet storm shows. A notable feature of WLNR was that the four regular deejays were women.[8]

Because of the popularity of his show, Lindsey saw his annual salary increase from $12,000 in 1977 to more than $100,000 in 1985.[9] After signing a million-dollar, five-year contract with rival Washington DC station WKYS, he left WHUR at the end of August 1985,[10] continuing the quiet storm format on WKYS for five years starting in November with a show called ""Melvin's Melodies"".[8] Part of Lindsey's original style was to mix different decades of music together, for instance playing a Sarah Vaughan ballad in between more modern numbers.[11]

Lindsey died of AIDS in 1992 at the age of 36, but the quiet storm format he originated remains a staple in American radio programming. WHUR radio still has a quiet storm show, and many urban, black radio stations still reserve their late-night programming slots for quiet storm music. WHUR operator Howard University has registered ""Quiet Storm"" as a trademark for ""entertainment services, namely, a continuing series of radio programs featuring music"".[12]

Hughes later built on the success of WHUR's quiet storm format to found Radio One, a broadcasting company aimed at African Americans.[13]

Quiet storm was most popular as a programming niche with baby boomers from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. During this era, it promoted a noticeable shift in the sound of R&B of the time. Quiet storm songs were in most cases devoid of any significant political commentary and maintained a strict aesthetic and narrative distance from issues relating to black urban life. Quiet storm appropriates R&B and soul ""slow jams"" and recontextualizes them into rotations with their peers and predecessors.[14]

Music journalist Jason King wrote, ""Sensuous and pensive, quiet storm is seductive R&B, marked by jazz flourishes, 'smooth grooves,' and tasteful lyrics about intimate subjects. As disco gave way to the 'urban contemporary' format at the outset of the 1980s, quiet storm expanded beyond radio to emerge as a broad catchall super-genre.""[4]

Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone called quiet storm a ""blend of pop, jazz fusion, and R&B ballads—all elegant and easy-flowing, like a flute of Veuve Clicquot champagne.""[15]

For some, the conception of quiet storm represented a shift in the gendered and sexualized musical landscapes of R&B and soul. Music journalist Eric Harvey said that within the quiet storm genre, artists such as Luther Vandross were able to push the boundaries of gender normativity in both their sound and lyricism.[14]  Author Jason King said that through the genre and his music more generally, ""Vandross toys with dominant conventions of male sexuality without engaging in androgyny or any explicit forms of traditionally feminine embodiment.""[16]

Given the sensuality and ""domesticity""[14] that the genre became recognized for, artists, particularly men, seemed to be awarded much more freedom in regards to expression of gender and sexuality, as opposed to what were viewed as more ""masculine"" genres.[14][17][18][19] Harvey went on to say: ""This is one of the most important and overlooked aspects of the Quiet Storm format, and something that Vandross did so well: embrace a male form of domestic sensuality, a musical ideal previously exclusive to women.""[14]

Quiet Storm emerged at a time when the US Black middle-class population was growing and the divide between the Black rich and poor was widening. ""The black suburban population doubled between 1970 and 1986, and the number of blacks attending college increased 500 percent between 1960 and 1977.""[14] Quiet Storm was an escape from politics and friction; it reassured Black communities with the feeling of stability and normalcy.[14]

In the 1990s, Canadian adult contemporary station CFQR-FM in Montreal aired a Quiet Storm program featuring new-age music. At least two non-commercial FM stations, the community-based WGDR in Plainfield, Vermont, and its sister station, WGDH in Hardwick, Vermont (both owned by Goddard College), have been broadcasting a weekly, two-hour ""Quiet Storm"" program since 1998—a 50-50 mix of smooth jazz and soft R&B, presented in ""Triple-A"" (Album Adult Alternative) style, with a strong emphasis on ""B"" and ""C"" album tracks that most commercial stations often ignore.

In 2007, Premiere Radio Networks launched a nationally syndicated nightly radio program based upon the quiet storm format, known as The Keith Sweat Hotel. That program, in edited form, broadcasts under the Quiet Storm name (as The Quiet Storm with Keith Sweat) on WBLS in New York City.[20]"
"Southern soul","

Southern soul is a type of soul music that emerged from the Southern United States. The music originated from a combination of styles, including blues (both 12 bar and jump), country, early R&B, and a strong gospel influence that emanated from the sounds of Southern black churches. Bass guitar, drums, horn section, and gospel roots vocal are important to soul groove. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of funk music. The terms ""deep soul"", ""country soul"",[1] ""downhome soul"" and ""hard soul"" have been used synonymously with ""Southern soul"".[2]p. 18

Some soul musicians were from southern states such as Georgia natives Otis Redding[3] and James Brown, Rufus Thomas and Bobby ""Blue"" Bland[4] (from Tennessee), Eddie Floyd (from Alabama), Lee Dorsey (from Louisiana). Southern soul was influenced by blues and gospel music.

Southern soul was at its peak late 1960s, when Memphis soul was popular. In 1963, Stan Lewis founded Jewel Records in Shreveport, Louisiana, along with two subsidiary labels, Paula and Ronn. Jewel and Ronn Records were among the leaders for R&B, blues, soul and gospel tunes. Lewis signed artists such as  John Lee Hooker, Charles Brown, Bobby Rush, Sam ""T-Bird"" Jensen, Buster Benton, Toissaint McCall, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Ted Taylor and Little Johnny Taylor.[5] In 1966, the Shreveport-based Murco Records released ""Losin' Boy"" by Eddy Giles, which registered for five weeks on Cashbox magazine's Hot 100. Murco Records had soul chart success with its other artist included Reuben Bell and the Belltones.

The other significant contributors were Stax Records[6] and their house band Booker T. & the MGs. The Stax label's most successful artist of the 1960s, Otis Redding, was influenced by fellow Georgia native Little Richard and the more cosmopolitan sounds of Mississippi-born Sam Cooke. Other Stax artists of note included Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Johnnie Taylor, the Staple Singers, the Dramatics (from Detroit) and Isaac Hayes. Atlantic Records artists Sam & Dave's records were released on the Stax label and featured the MGs. Wilson Pickett launched his solo career through his collaboration with the Stax team.

After Sam & Dave moved from Stax to Atlantic Records,[7] Stax producer David Porter and his songwriting and production partner Isaac Hayes decided to put together a new vocal group of two men and two women. They recruited J. Blackfoot, together with Norman West, Anita Louis, and Shelbra Bennett, to form The Soul Children. Between 1968 and 1978, The Soul Children had 15 hits on the R&B chart, including three that crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, and recorded seven albums.[8][9]

Another Memphis label, Goldwax Records, featured O.V. Wright, James Carr, and Spencer Wiggins, while Al Green, Don Bryant, and Ann Peebles recorded for Memphis's Hi Records, where they were produced by Willie Mitchell. Also influential was the ""Muscle Shoals Sound"", originating from Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section played on hits by many Stax artists during the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, and Atlantic Records artists Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Joe Tex and Aretha Franklin. In 1983, former Soul Children singer J. Blackfoot saw success on soul chart with his single ""Taxi"".[10] In 1987, Marvin Sease had an R&B hit with ""Candy Licker"".

After 1990, southern soul music was still recorded and performed by singers such as Sharon Jones,[11]Charles Bradley,[12]Peggy Scott-Adams, Trudy Lynn,[13]Roy C, Sir Charles Jones, Barbara Carr, Willie Clayton, Bobby Rush, Denise LaSalle, Gwen McCrae, Johnnie Taylor,[14] and William Bell."
"Alternative rock","Alternative rock (also known as alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a category of rock music that evolved from the independent music underground of the 1970s. Alternative rock acts achieved mainstream success in the 1990s with the likes of the grunge, shoegaze, and Britpop subgenres in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. During this period, many record labels were looking for alternatives, as many corporate rock, hard rock, and glam metal acts from the 1980s were beginning to grow stale throughout the music industry. The emergence of Generation X as a cultural force in the 1990s also contributed greatly to the rise of alternative rock.
Alternative refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock.[4] Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In September 1988, Billboard introduced alternative into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.[5][6]
Initially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction, were signed to major labels. Most alternative bands at the time, like the Smiths, one of the key British alternative rock bands during the 1980s, remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream, and many alternative bands became successful.
Emo found mainstream success in the 2000s with multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Paramore and Panic! at the Disco. Bands such as the White Stripes and the Strokes found commercial success in the early 2000s, influencing an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from garage rock, post-punk and new wave, establishing a revival of the genres."
"Dream pop","

Dream pop (also typeset as dreampop)[7] is a subgenre of alternative rock[8] and neo-psychedelia[9] that emphasizes atmosphere and sonic texture as much as pop melody. Common characteristics include breathy vocals, dense productions, and effects such as reverb, echo, tremolo, and chorus.  It often overlaps with the related genre of shoegaze, and the two genre terms have at times been used interchangeably.

The genre came into prominence in the 1980s through the work of groups such as Cocteau Twins and A.R. Kane. Subsequently, acts such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Galaxie 500, Julee Cruise, Lush, and Mazzy Star released significant albums in the style. It saw renewed popularity among millennial listeners following the late-2000s success of acts such as Beach House.

The term dream pop is thought to relate to the ""immersion"" in the music experienced by the listener.[10]The AllMusic Guide to Electronica (2003) defined dream pop as ""an atmospheric subgenre of alternative rock that relies on sonic textures as much as melody"".[11] According to Paste, the genre emphasizes mood and sonics over lyrics, so that ""chords and tracks blur seamlessly into one another so frequently that it can be difficult to even decipher when one song ended and another has begun.""[12] Common characteristics are breathy vocals, the use of guitar effects, and a densely produced sound,[11] with ""nebulous, distorted guitars"" paired with ""murmured vocals sometimes completely smudged into a wall of noise.""[9] The music tends to focus on textures rather than propulsive rock riffs.[13] Effects such as reverb and echo are ubiquitous, with tremolo and chorus also heard on recordings.[3]

Lyrics are often introspective or existential in nature,[13] but may be difficult to hear or incomprehensible in the mix.[12] In the view of critic Simon Reynolds, dream pop ""celebrates rapturous and transcendent experiences, often using druggy and mystical imagery"".[9] In 1991, he suggested this escapist tendency might be a response to the cultural landscape of the UK during the 1980s: ""After 12 years of Conservative government in Britain, any idealism or constructive political involvement seems futile to these alienated middle-class dropouts.""[9] Similarly, according to Rachel Felder, dream pop artists often resist representations of social reality in favour of ambiguous or hallucinogenic experiences.[14]

Author Nathan Wiseman-Trowse writes that the ""approach to the sheer physicality of sound"" integral to dream pop was ""arguably pioneered in popular music by figures such as Phil Spector and [Beach Boys founder] Brian Wilson.""[14] The music of the Velvet Underground in the 1960s and 1970s, which experimented with repetition, tone and texture over conventional song structure, was also an important touchstone in the genre's development.[14] Their 1967 debut The Velvet Underground & Nico incorporated what music critic Marc Beamount terms ""psychedelic dream pop"" in addition to a variety of other styles.[15] 1960s band the Byrds would influence the ""swoony harmonies"" of later British dream pop groups.[9]

The Beach Boys recorded an early dream pop song, ""All I Wanna Do"", for their 1970 album Sunflower.[16][17][18] Critic Jim Allen, who cites the Beach Boys as the ""godfathers"" of dream pop on 2021, says that the song's unprecedented ""cinematic dream sequence"" production style marks the point ""where the dream pop family tree starts to come into focus.""[16] However, the Beach Boys' impact on the genre was not widely acknowledged until after the 2000s.[16]

Music journalist John Bergstrom recognises George Harrison's 1970 track ""Let It Down"" as a progenitor of the genre, while stating that its Spector-produced parent album All Things Must Pass influenced ""many guitar-driven, echo-drenched bands have come around since, mixing powerful rave-ups with moody, reflective down-tempo numbers and a spiritual bent.[19]

A.J. Ramirez of PopMatters recognises an evolutionary line from gothic rock to dream pop.[2] The early 1980s gothic-derived ""ethereal wave"" subgenre, with its effects-laden guitar sounds and female vocals, led to the dream pop and shoegaze scenes; it was represented by Cocteau Twins and labels such as 4AD and Projekt Records.[20]Rolling Stone describes ""modern dream pop"" as originating with the early 1980s work of Cocteau Twins and their contemporaries.[21]AllMusic's Jason Ankeny credits the Cocteau Twins' ""distinctly ethereal"" sound and singer Elizabeth Fraser's operatic, indecipherable vocals with defining their label, the UK-based 4AD.[22] According to Pitchfork, Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column ""embodied the cliché of the suicidal dream-pop guitarist in the mid-1980s"" with his ""narcotic performances"" presaging later acts such as My Bloody Valentine and Galaxie 500.[23]

The 1984 album It'll End in Tears by 4AD's ""dream-pop supergroup"" This Mortal Coil[21] was conceived by label head Ivo Watts-Russell and featured members of Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance. The album helped ""set the template for dream pop"" and associated the formerly gothic-affiliated UK label with the style.[24] The album's 1983 single, the Tim Buckley cover ""Song to the Siren"", became an influential work in the genre, and saw success in the UK Indie Chart, remaining there consistently for two years.[24] Film director David Lynch, unable to obtain the rights to This Mortal Coil's version of ""Song to the Siren"" for his 1986 film Blue Velvet, enlisted composer Angelo Badalamenti and singer Julee Cruise to record a replacement track. The result was ""Mysteries of Love"", described by Rolling Stone as a significant development of the dream pop sound which ""gave the genre its synthy sheen"".[21] The trio of Cruise, Lynch and Badalamenti later recorded the 1989 album Floating into the Night, which further elaborated on the style and featured the Twin Peaks theme and UK top 10 single ""Falling"".[21]

The term ""dreampop"" was coined in the late 1980s by Alex Ayuli of A.R. Kane to describe his band's eclectic sound, which blended ethereal dub production, effects-laden guitar, and drum machine backing, among other influences.[25] The group signed to 4AD to release their 1987 EP Lollita, produced by Cocteau Twins guitarist Robin Guthrie.[26]Pitchfork describes their debut album Sixty Nine (1988) as a ""crucial document"" of the dream pop movement, commenting that the group ""aimed to emulate an ethereality that could just as easily become nightmarish"", resulting in music that feels ""just out of reach, like your memory struggling to grasp the last wisp of a dream before it slips away.""[27] Their ""dreampop"" label was subsequently adopted by music critic Simon Reynolds to describe that group[28] and later extended to the nascent shoegazing scene in the UK.[9] Reynolds describes the movement as ""a wave of hazy neo-psychedelic groups"" characterised by a ""blurry, blissful sound"", and credits the influence of the ""ethereal soundscapes"" of Cocteau Twins as well as more distorted styles of American alternative rock.[9]

In the 1990s, ""dream pop"" and ""shoegazing"" were interchangeable and regionally dependent terms, with ""dream pop"" being the name by which ""shoegazing"" was typically known in America.[29] AllMusic describes the dream pop label as covering both the ""loud, shimmering feedback"" of My Bloody Valentine and the ""post-Velvet Underground guitar rock"" of Galaxie 500.[30] My Bloody Valentine showcased a unique dream pop sound on their 1988 debut album Isn't Anything, with guitarist Kevin Shields employing a tremolo-arm technique in order to produce ""an amorphous drone, at once visceral and disembodied"".[9] Galaxie 500 provided a ""cornerstone"" of the genre in their 1989 album On Fire, with their downtempo, reverb-laden sound becoming influential.[12] UK bands acts as A.R. Kane, My Bloody Valentine and Ride played an influential role in the development of the movement.[31] Other prominent acts to emerge from the movement include Slowdive and Chapterhouse.[9]

The 1990 Cocteau Twins album Heaven or Las Vegas proved an iconic release in the genre.[24] The UK band Lush became an influential act in the genre during the 1990s, with Robin Guthrie producing their 1992 debut album Spooky.[31] The 1993 album So Tonight That I Might See by American band Mazzy Star reflected a dream pop sound specific to ""the glitzy decay that is L.A."", according to Pitchfork; that publication called the album a ""dream pop classic"".[32] The late 1980s dream pop of A.R. Kane and My Bloody Valentine influenced 1990s acts such as Seefeel and Insides,[33] who began incorporating elements such as samples and sequenced rhythms.[34]Ambient pop music is described by AllMusic as ""essentially an extension of the dream pop that emerged in the wake of the shoegazer movement"", distinct for its incorporation of electronic textures and techniques such as sampling.[6]

The 2007 album Person Pitch by Panda Bear combined Beach Boys-influenced dream pop with modern sampledelic techniques, winning acclaim and exerting a wide influence.[35]
Much of the music associated with the 2009-coined term ""chillwave"" could be considered dream pop;[7] In the opinion of Grantland's David Schilling, the critical discussion surrounding ""chillwave"" revealed that labels such as ""shoegaze"" and ""dream pop"" were ultimately ""arbitrary and meaningless"".[36] The 2010 album Teen Dream by Baltimore duo Beach House established the group as purveyors of modern dream pop that drew on the ""languid reveries"" of Cocteau Twins, Mazzy Star and Galaxie 500.[24] The group's success in the late 2000s solidified the popularity of dream pop with millennial listeners.[3]"
"Grunge","Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is an alternative rock genre and subculture which emerged during the mid-1980s in the U.S. state of Washington, particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal.[3] The genre featured the distorted electric guitar sound used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, self-doubt, abuse, neglect, betrayal, social and emotional isolation, addiction, psychological trauma and a desire for freedom.[5][6]

The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop and the region's underground music scene. The owners of Sub Pop marketed the style shrewdly, encouraging the media to describe it as ""grunge""; the style became known as a hybrid of punk and metal.[7] By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals. Grunge was commercially successful in the early-to-mid-1990s due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music.[8]

Several factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the mid-to-late 1990s, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as ""the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest"", struggled with an addiction to heroin before his suicide in 1994. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture[9] and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself.[10] Grunge was also an influence on later genres such as post-grunge.

The word ""grunge"" is American slang for ""someone or something that is repugnant"" and also for ""dirt"".[11][12] The word was first recorded as being applied to Seattle musicians in July 1987 when Bruce Pavitt described Green River's Dry as a Bone EP in a Sub Pop record company catalogue as ""gritty vocals, roaring Marshall amps, ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation"".[13] Although the word ""grunge"" has been used to describe bands since the 1960s, this was the first association of grunge with the grinding, sludgy sound of Seattle.[14][15] It is expensive and time-consuming to get a recording to sound clean, so for those northwestern bands just starting out it was cheaper for them to leave the sound dirty and just turn up their volume.[14] This dirty sound, due to low budgets, unfamiliarity with recording, and a lack of professionalism may be the origin of the term ""grunge"".[16]

The ""Seattle scene"" refers to that city's alternative music movement that was linked to the University of Washington and the Evergreen State College. Evergreen is a progressive college which does not use a conventional grading system and has its own radio station, KAOS. Seattle's remoteness from Los Angeles led to a perceived purity of its music. The music of these bands, many of which had recorded with Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, became labeled as ""grunge"".[17] Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain, in one of his final interviews, credited Jonathan Poneman, cofounder of Sub Pop, with coining the term ""grunge"" to describe the music.[18]

The term ""Seattle sound"" became a marketing ploy for the music industry.[17] In September 1991, the Nirvana album Nevermind was released, bringing mainstream attention to the music of Seattle. Cobain loathed the word ""grunge""[3] and despised the new scene that was developing, feeling that record companies were signing old ""cock-rock"" bands who were pretending to be grunge and claiming to be from Seattle.[19]

Some bands associated with the genre, such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, have not been receptive to the label, preferring instead to be referred to as ""rock and roll"" bands.[20][21][22]Ben Shepherd from Soundgarden stated that he ""hates the word"" grunge and hates ""being associated with it.""[23] Seattle musician Jeff Stetson states that when he visited Seattle in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a touring musician, the local musicians did not refer to themselves as ""grunge"" performers or their style as ""grunge"" and they were not flattered that their music was being called ""grunge"".[24]

Rolling Stone noted the genre's lack of a clear definition.[25] Robert Loss acknowledges the challenges of defining ""grunge""; stating that while he can recount stories about grunge, they do not serve to provide a useful definition.[26] Roy Shuker states that the term ""obscured a variety of styles.""[17] Stetson states that grunge was not a movement, ""monolithic musical genre"", or a way to react to 1980s-era metal pop; he calls the term a misnomer mostly based on hype.[24] Stetson states that prominent bands considered to be grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney and Hammerbox) all sound different.[24] Mark Yarm, author of Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge, pointed out vast differences between grunge bands, with some being punk and others being metal-based.[23]

In 1984, the punk rock band Black Flag toured small towns across the US to bring punk to the more remote parts of the country. By this time, their music had become slow and sludgy, less like the Sex Pistols and more like Black Sabbath. Krist Novoselic, later the bassist with Nirvana, recalled going with the Melvins to see one of these shows, after which Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne began writing ""slow and heavy riffs"" to form a dirge-like music that was the beginning of northwest grunge.[27] The Melvins were the most influential of the early grunge bands.[3] Sub Pop producer Jack Endino described grunge as ""seventies-influenced, slowed-down punk music"".[28][29]

Leighton Beezer, who played with Mark Arm and Steve Turner in the Thrown Ups, state that when he heard Green River play Come On Down, he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. He noted that the diminished fifth note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary Hype!, Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from ""Rockaway Beach"" by the Ramones that ascends the neck of the guitar, then ""Come On Down"" by Green River that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound unalike.[30][31] He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge.[32] Early grunge bands would also copy a riff from metal and slow it down, play it backwards, distort it and bury it in feedback, then shout lyrics with little melody over the top of it.[14]

Grunge fuses elements of punk rock (specifically American hardcore punk such as Black Flag) and heavy metal (especially traditional, earlier heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath), although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other.[8][better source needed] Alex DiBlasi feels that indie rock was a third key source, with the most important influence coming from Sonic Youth's ""free-form"" noise.[4] Grunge shares with punk a raw, lo fi sound and similar lyrical concerns,[8][better source needed] and it also used punk's haphazard and untrained approach to playing and performing. However, grunge was ""deeper and darker""-sounding than punk rock and it decreased the ""adrenaline""-fueled tempos of punk to a slow, ""sludgy"" speed,[33] and used more dissonant harmonies. Seattle music journalist Charles R. Cross defines ""grunge"" as distortion-filled, down-tuned and riff-based rock that uses loud electric guitar feedback and heavy, ""ponderous"" basslines to support its song melodies.[34] Robert Loss calls grunge a melding of ""violence and speed, muscularity and melody"", where there is space for all people, including women musicians.[26]VH1 writer Dan Tucker feels that different grunge bands were influenced by different genres; that while Nirvana drew on punk, Pearl Jam was influenced by classic rock, and that ""sludgy, dark, heavy bands"" such as Soundgarden and Alice in Chains had a sinister metal tone.[35]

Grunge music has what has been called an ""ugly"" aesthetic, both in the roar of the distorted electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the ""slick"" elegant sound of the then-predominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the ""ugliness"" they saw around them and shine a light on unseen ""depths and depravity"" of the real world.[36] Some key individuals in the development of the grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, described grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as ""musical provocation"". Grunge artists considered these bands ""cheesy"" but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with.[37] In the early-1990s, Nirvana's signature ""stop-start"" song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention.[8][better source needed]

In the book Accidental Revolution: The Story of Grunge, Kyle Anderson wrote:

The twelve songs on Sixteen Stone sound exactly like what grunge is supposed to sound like, while the whole point of grunge was that it didn't really sound like anything, including itself. Just consider how many different bands and styles of music have been shoved under the ""grunge"" header in this discography alone, and you realize that grunge is probably the most ill-defined genre of music in history.[38]

Grunge guitarists like Kurt Cobain often used ""offset"" guitars like the Fender Jaguar, Fender Jazzmaster, or Mustang. They used primarily offset guitars because at the time they were unpopular enough to offer a new image as opposed to more frequently seen Gibson Les Pauls or Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster used by mainstream pop & rock bands. Being unpopular when grunge started, offset guitars also offered excellent bang for buck.[39]  
Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a thick middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet.[40] Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers[41] and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs).[42] Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most ""lugubrious sound""; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive ""buildup of sonic fog"".[43] or even dismissed as ""noise"" by one critic.[44] As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.[33]

Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their ""dirty"" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder.[42] Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps).[42] The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff.[45] In the song ""Mudride"", the band's guitars were said to have ""growled malevolently"" through its ""Cro-magnon slog"".[46]

Other key pedals used by grunge bands included four brands of distortion pedals (the Big Muff, DOD, and Boss DS-2 and Boss DS-1 distortion pedals) and the Small Clone chorus effect, used by Kurt Cobain on ""Come As You Are"" and by the Screaming Trees on ""Nearly Lost You"".[42] The DS-1 (later DS-2) distortion pedal played a key role in Cobain's switching from quiet to loud and back to quiet approach to songwriting.[47] The use of small pedals by grunge guitarists helped to start off the revival of interest in boutique, hand-soldered, 1970s-style analog pedals.[40] The other effect that grunge guitarists used was one of the most low-tech effects devices, the wah-wah pedal. Both ""[Kim] Thayil and Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell ... were great advocates of the wah wah pedal.""[40] Wah was also used by the Screaming Trees, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr.[42]

Grunge guitarists played loud, with Kurt Cobain's early guitar sound coming from an unusual set-up of four 800 watt PA system power amplifiers.[40]Guitar feedback effects, in which a highly amplified electric guitar is held in front of its speaker, were used to create high-pitched, sustained sounds that are not possible with regular guitar technique. Grunge guitarists were influenced by the raw, primitive sound of punk, and they favored ""... energy and lack of finesse over technique and precision""; key guitar influences included the Sex Pistols, the Dead Boys, Celtic Frost, King's X, Voivod, Neil Young[48] (Rust Never Sleeps, side two), the Replacements, Hüsker Dü, Black Flag, and the Melvins.[49] Grunge guitarists often downtuned their instruments for a lower, heavier sound.[40]Soundgarden's guitarist, Kim Thayil, did not use a regular guitar amplifier; instead, he used a bass combo amp equipped with a 15-inch speaker as he played low riffs, and the bass amp gave him a deeper tone.[40]

Grunge guitarists ""flatly rejected"" the virtuoso ""shredding"" guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs, instead opting for melodic, blues-inspired solos – focusing ""on the song, not the guitar solo"".[50]Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill.[51] In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had ""guitar anti-heroes"" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument.[49]

In Will Byers' article ""Grunge committed a crime against music—it killed the guitar solo"" in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge.[52] He also states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he then says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement.[53] The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana ""killed the guitar solo"".[54]Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the ""death of the guitar solo""; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo.[55] Baeble Music calls the grunge guitar solos of the 1990s ""raw"", ""sloppy"", and ""basic"".[56]

Not all sources support the ""grunge killed the guitar solo"" argument. Sean Gonzalez states that Pearl Jam has plentiful examples of guitar solos.[54]Michael Azerrad praises the guitar playing of Mudhoney's Steve Turner, calling him the ""Eric Clapton of grunge"", a reference to the British blues guitarist[57] who Time magazine has named as number five in their list of ""The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players"".[58]Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready has been praised for his blues-influenced, rapid licks.[59]The Smashing Pumpkins' guitarist Billy Corgan has been called the ""arena rock genius of the '90s"" for pioneering guitar playing techniques and showing through his playing skill that grunge guitarists do not have to be sloppy players to rebel against mainstream music.[59] Thayil stated that when other major grunge bands, such as Nirvana, were reducing their guitar solos, Soundgarden responded by bringing back the solos.[55]

The early Seattle grunge album Skin Yard recorded in 1987 by the band of the same name included fuzz bass (overdriven bass guitar) played by Jack Endino and Daniel House.[60] Some grunge bassists, such as Ben Shepherd, layered power chords with distorted low-end density by adding a fifth and an octave-higher note to a bass note.[61]

An example of the powerful, loud bass amplifier systems used in grunge is Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez's setup. He uses four powerful Ampeg SVT-2 PRO tube amplifier heads, two of them plugged into four 1×18"" subwoofer cabinets for the low register, and the other two plugged into two 8×10"" cabinets.[62] Krist Novoselic and Jeff Ament are also known for using Ampeg SVT tube amplifiers.[63][64] Ben Shepherd uses a 300 watt all-tube Ampeg SVT-VR amp and a 600 watt Mesa/Boogie Carbine M6 amplifier.[65] Ament uses four 6×10"" speaker cabinets.[64]

In contrast to the ""massive drum kits"" used in 1980s pop metal,[66] grunge drummers used relatively smaller drum kits. One example is the drumkit used by Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron's set-up. He uses a six-piece kit (this way of describing drumkits counts only the wooden drums, and does not count the cymbals), including a ""12×8-inch rack tom; 13×9-inch rack tom; 16×14-inch floor tom; 18×16-inch floor tom; 24×14-inch bass drum"" and a snare drum and, for cymbals, Zildjian instruments, including ""... 14-inch K Light [Hi-]hats; 17-inch K Custom Dark crash [cymbal] and 18-inch K Crash Ride; 19-inch Projection crash; a 20-inch Rezo crash; ... and a ... 22-inch A Medium ride [cymbal]"".[67]

A second example is Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's set-up during 1990 and 1991. He used a four-piece Tama drumset, with an 8"" × 14"" birch snare drum, a 14"" × 15"" rack tom, a 16"" × 18"" floor tom, and a 16"" × 24"" bass drum (this kit ""was demolished at the Cabaret Metro, Chicago, 10/12/91"").[68] Like Matt Cameron, Dave Grohl used Zildjian cymbals. Grohl used the company's A Series Medium cymbals, including an 18"" and a 20"" crash cymbal, a 22"" ride cymbal, and a pair of 15"" hi-hat cymbals.[68]

Although other instruments are generally not included in grunge, Seattle band Gorilla created controversy by breaking the ""guitars only"" approach and using a 1960s-style Vox organ in their group.[69]
In 2002, Pearl Jam added a keyboard player, Kenneth ""Boom"" Gaspar, who played piano, Hammond organ, and other keyboards; the addition of a keyboardist to the band would have been ""inconceivable"" in the band's ""grungy"" early years, but it shows how a group's sound can change over time.[70]

The grunge singing style was similar to the ""outburst"" of loud, heavily distorted electric guitar in tone and delivery; Kurt Cobain used a ""gruff, slurred articulation and gritty timbre"" and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam made use of a ""wide, powerful vibrato"" to show his ""depth of expression.""[45]Layne Staley voiced lyrics with a ""heaviness"" and tremolo.[71]  In general, grunge singers used a ""deeper vocal style"" which matched the lower-sounding, downtuned guitars and the darker-themed lyrical messages used in the style.[40] Grunge singers used ""gravelly, raspy"" vocals,[33] ""... growls, moans, screams and mumbles""[72] and ""plaintive groans""; this range of singing styles was used to communicate the ""varied emotions"" of the lyrics.[73] Cobain's reaction to the ""bad times"" and discontent of the era was that he screamed his lyrics.[74] In general, grunge songs were sung ""simply, often somewhat unintelligibly""; the virtuoso ""operatics of hair-metal were shunned.""[74] Grunge singing has been characterized as ""borderline out-of-tune vocals"".[75]

Grunge lyrics are typically dark, nihilistic,[4] wretched, angst-filled and anguished, often addressing themes such as social alienation, self-doubt, abuse, assault, neglect, betrayal, social isolation/emotional isolation, psychological trauma, and a desire for freedom.[5][6]

An article by MIT states that grunge ""lyrics [were] obsessed with disenfranchisement"" and described a mood of ""resigned despair"".[76] Catherine Strong, in her book""Grunge: Music and Memory"", states that grunge songs were usually about ""negative experiences or feelings"", with the main themes being alienation and depression, but with an ""ironic sneer.""[77] Grunge artists expressed ""strong feelings"" in their lyrics about ""societal ills"", including a ""desire to 'crucify the insincere'"", an approach which fans appreciated for its authenticity.[78] Grunge lyrics have been criticized as ""violent and often obscene.""[79] In 1996, conservative columnist Rich Lowry wrote an essay criticizing grunge, entitled ""Heroin, Our Hero""; he called it a music that is mostly ""... shorn of ideals and the impulse for political action"".[80]

A number of factors influenced the focus on such subject matter. Many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society, as well as a discomfort with social prejudices. Grunge lyrics contained ""explicit political messages and ... questioning about ... society and how it might be changed.""[81] While grunge lyrics were less overtly political than punk songs, grunge songs still indicated a concern for social issues, particularly those affecting young people.[77] The main themes in grunge were ""tolerance of difference"", ""support of women"", ""mistrust of authority"" and ""cynicism towards big corporations.""[77] Grunge song themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians.[8][better source needed] In 1992, music critic Simon Reynolds said that ""there's a feeling of burnout in the culture at large. Kids are depressed about the future"".[82] The topics of grunge lyrics–homelessness, suicide, rape,[77] ""broken homes, drug addiction and self-loathing""–contrasted sharply to the glam metal lyrics of Poison, which described ""life in the fast lane"",[83] partying, and hedonism.

Grunge lyrics developed as part of ""Generation X malaise"", reflecting that demographic's feelings of ""disillusionment and uselessness"".[84] Grunge songs about love were usually about ""failed, boring, doomed or destructive relationships"" (e.g., ""Black"" by Pearl Jam).[77] The Alice in Chains songs ""Sickman"", ""Junkhead"", ""God Smack"", and ""Hate to Feel"" have references to heroin.[85][86] Grunge lyrics tended to be more introspective and aimed to enable the listener to see into ""hidden"" personal issues and examine the ""depravity"" of the world.[36] This approach can be seen in Mudhoney's song ""Touch Me I'm Sick"", which includes lyrics with ""deranged imagery"" which depict a ""broken world and a fragmented self-image""; the song includes the lines ""I feel bad, and I've felt worse"" and ""I won't live long and I'm full of rot"".[33] Nirvana's song ""Lithium"", from their 1991 album Nevermind, is about a ""man who finds faith after his girlfriend's suicide""; it depicts ""irony and ugliness"" as a way of dealing with these ""dark issues"".[36]

Like punk, grunge's sound came from a lo fi (low fidelity) recording and production approach.[33] Before the arrival of major labels, early grunge albums were recorded using low-budget analogue studios: ""Nirvana's first album Bleach, was recorded for $606.17 in 1989.""[87]Sub Pop recorded most of their music at a ""low-rent studio named Reciprocal"", where producer Jack Endino created the grunge genre's aesthetic, a ""raw and unpolished sound with distortion, but usually without any added studio effects"".[88] Endino is known for his stripped-down recording practices and his dislike of 'over-producing' music with effects and remastering. His work on Soundgarden's Screaming Life and Nirvana's Bleach as well as for the bands Green River, Screaming Trees, L7, the Gits, Hole, 7 Year Bitch, and Tad helped to define the grunge sound. An example of the lower cost production approach is Mudhoney; even after the band signed to Warner Music, ""[t]rue to [the band's] indie roots ... [they are] ... probably one of the few bands that would have to fight [their label] to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one.""[57]

Steve Albini was another important influence on the grunge sound. Albini prefers to be called a ""recording engineer"", because he believes that putting record producers in charge of recording sessions often destroys the band's real sound, while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians, not to threaten the artists' control over their creative product.[89] Albini's recordings have been analyzed by writers such as Michael Azerrad, who stated that Albini's ""recordings were both very basic and very exacting: like Endino, Albini used few special effects; got an aggressive, often violent guitar sound; and made sure the rhythm section slammed as one.""[90]

Nirvana's In Utero is a typical example of Albini's recording approach. He preferred to have the entire band play live in the studio, rather than use mainstream rock's approach of recording each instrument on a separate track at different times, and then mixing them using multi-track recording.[citation needed] While multitracking results in a more polished product, it does not capture the ""live"" sound of the band playing together. Albini used a range of different microphones for the vocals and instruments. Like most metal and punk recording engineers, he mics the guitar amp speakers and bass amp speakers to capture each performer's unique tone.[citation needed]

Grunge concerts were known for being straightforward, high-energy performances. Grunge shows were ""celebrations, parties [and] carnivals"", where the audience expressed its spirit by stagediving, moshing and thrashing.[91] Simon Reynolds states that in ""... some of the most masculine forms of rock—thrash metal, grunge, moshing becomes a form of surrogate combat"" in which ""male bodies"" can contact in the ""sweat-and-bloodbath"" of the moshpit.[92] As with punk shows, grunge ""performances were about frontmen who screamed and jumped around on stage and musicians who thrashed wildly on their instruments.""[93] While grunge lyrical themes focused on ""angst and rage"", the audience at shows were positive and created a ""life-affirming"" attitude.[91] Grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres, including the use of complex digitally controlled light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects then popular in ""hair metal"" shows. Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and ""onstage theatrics"" were generally avoided.[83]

Instead the bands presented themselves as no different from minor local bands. Jack Endino said in Hype! that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective was not to be entertainers, but simply to ""rock out"".[37] Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as ""a symbolic weapon"" for releasing ""pent-up aggression"" (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his ""head flips"").[94] Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, ""for Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music ... And if you can't, can you live with being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?""[95]

.mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}Clothing commonly worn by grunge musicians in Washington were a ""mundane everyday style"", in which they would wear the same clothes on stage that they wore at home.[33] This Pacific Northwest ""slacker style"" or ""slouch look"" contrasted sharply with the ""wild"" mohawks, leather jackets and chains worn by punks. This everyday clothing approach was used by grunge musicians because authenticity was a key principle in the Seattle scene.[33] The grunge look typically consisted of second-hand clothes or thrift store items and the typical outdoor clothing (most notably flannel shirts) of the region, as well as a generally unkempt appearance and long hair.[83] For grunge singers, long hair was used ""as a mask to conceal the face"" so they can ""expres[s their] innermost thoughts""; Cobain is a notable example.[94] Male grunge musicians were ""... unkempt ... [and] ... unshaven[96] [,] with ... tousled hair""[97] that was often unwashed, greasy and ""... matted [into a] sheep-dog mop"".[98]

The lumberjack attire was a common sight in the thrift stores near Seattle for the low prices that musicians could afford.[99] Grunge style consisted of ripped jeans, thermal underwear,[84]Doc Martens boots or combat boots (often unlaced), band T-shirts, oversized knit sweaters, long and droopy skirts, ripped tights, Birkenstocks, hiking boots,[100][101][102] and eco-friendly clothing made from recycled textiles or fair trade organic cotton.[103] As well, since women in the grunge scene wore the ""... same plaid [shirt]s, boots, and short cropped heads as their male counterparts"", women showed ""... that they are not defined by their sex appeal.""[104]

""Grunge ... became an anti-consumerist movement where the less you spent on clothes, the more 'coolness' you had.""[105] The style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, ""[Nirvana frontman] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo"", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, ""This [clothing] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs against the grain of the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s.""[82] The flannel and ""... cracked leatherette coats"" in the grunge scene were part of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop aesthetic.[98]  Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the ""manufactured image"",[106] often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the 'grunge look' in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad ""were given blue collar identities that weren't entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.""[107]

Dazed magazine called Courtney Love one of ""ten women who defined the 1990s"" from a style perspective: the ""... image of Courtney Love's too-short baby doll dress, tattered fur coat and shock of platinum hair"", a look dubbed ""kinderwhore"", ""... topped with a tiara, of course – is seared on the memory of anyone who lived through the decade.""[108] The kinderwhore look consisted of torn, ripped tight or low-cut babydoll and Peter-Pan-collared dresses, slips, heavy makeup with dark eyeliner,[109] barrettes, and leather boots or Mary–Jane shoes.[110][111][112]Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland was the first to define it, while Courtney Love of Hole was the first to popularize it. Love has claimed that she took the style from Divinyls frontwoman Chrissy Amphlett.[110] The look became very popular in 1994.[113]

Vogue stated in 2014 that ""Cobain pulled liberally from both ends of a woman's and a man's wardrobe, and his Seattle thrift-store look ran the gamut of masculine lumberjack workwear and 40s-by-way-of-70s feminine dresses. It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny.""[114] Cobain's way of dressing ""was the antithesis of the macho American man"", because he ""... made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no matter if you were a boy or a girl.""[114] Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress ""Not only did he make it okay to be a freak, he made it desirable.""[114]

Grunge music hit the mainstream in the early 1990s with bands such as Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994.[100][115][116] As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts to cash in on the trend.[105] Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992 (the Spring 1993 Collection,) featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ""realism"" of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts.[117] This did, however, not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.[106]

In the same year, Vogue did a spread called ""Grunge & Glory"" with fashion photographer Steven Meisel who shot supermodels Kristen McMenamy, Naomi Campbell, and Nadja Auermann in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing.[118][119] This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, as she had her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks.[117] In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: ""to me the thing about grunge is it's not anti-fashion, it's unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.""[120] The unkempt fashion sense defined the look of the ""slacker generation"", who ""skipped school, smoked pot ... [and] cigarettes and listened to music"" hoping to become a rock star one day.[107]

Even though the grunge movement died down in 1994 after the death of Kurt Cobain, designers have continued to draw inspiration from the movement from time to time. Grunge appeared as a trend again in 2008, and for Fall/Winter 2013, Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent brought back grunge to the runway. With Courtney Love as his muse for the collection, she reportedly loved the collection. ""No offense to MJ [Marc Jacobs] but he never got it right,"" Courtney said. ""This is what it really was. Hedi knows his shit. He got it accurate, and MJ and Anna [Sui] did not.""[121]  Both Cobain and Love apparently burnt the Perry Ellis collection they received from Marc Jacobs back in 1993.[122] In 2016, grunge inspired an upscale ""reinvention"" of the style by A$AP Rocky, Rihanna and Kanye West.[123] However, ""dressing grunge is no longer a badge of authenticity, though: the signifiers of rebellion (Dr Martens boots, tartan shirts) are omnipotent on the high street"", says Lynette Nylander, deputy editor of i-D magazine.[123]

Many music subcultures are associated with particular drugs, such as the hippie counterculture and reggae, both of which are associated with marijuana and psychedelics. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of heroin by musicians in the Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 New York Times article listing the city's ""three principal drugs"" as ""espresso, beer and heroin""[87] and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the ""... subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin"".[124]Tim Jonze from The Guardian states that ""... heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its inception in the mid-80s"" and he argues that the ""... involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect to the music""; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland, as well as Courtney Love, Mark Lanegan, Jimmy Chamberlin and Evan Dando ""... all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell the tale.""[125] A 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s, people used the ""stimulant"" cocaine to socialize and ""... celebrate good times"", in the 1990s grunge scene, the ""depressant"" heroin was used to ""retreat"" into a ""cocoon"" and be ""... sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offered ... few prospects for ... change or hope.""[126] Justin Henderson states that all of the ""downer"" opiates, including ""heroin, morphine, etorphine, codeine, opium, [and] hydrocodone ... seemed to be the habit of choice for many a grunger"".[127]

The title of Nirvana's debut album Bleach was inspired by a harm reduction poster aimed at heroin injection users, which stated ""Bleach your works [e.g., syringe and needle] before you get stoned"". The poster was released by the U.S. State Health Department which was trying to reduce AIDS transmission caused through sharing used needles. Alice in Chains' song ""God Smack"" includes the line ""stick your arm for some real fun"", a reference to injecting heroin.[124] Seattle musicians known to use heroin included Cobain, who was using ""heroin when he shot himself in the head""; ""Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone [who] overdosed on heroin in 1990""; ""Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch [who] died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992 ... [and] Layne Staley of Alice in Chains [who] publicly detailed his battles with heroin ..."".[128]Mike Starr of Alice in Chains[126]  and Jonathan Melvoin from the Smashing Pumpkins also died from heroin. After Cobain's death, his ""... widow, singer Courtney Love, characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than in San Francisco or Los Angeles.""[128]

However, Daniel House, who owned C/Z Records, disputed these perceptions in 1994. House stated that there was ""... no more (heroin) here [in Seattle] than anyplace else""; he stated that the ""heroin is not a big part of the [Seattle music] culture"", and that ""marijuana and alcohol ... are far more prevalent"". Jeff Gilbert, one of the editors of Guitar World magazine, stated in 1994 that the media association of the Seattle grunge scene with heroin was ""really overblown""; instead, he says that Seattle musicians were ""... all a bunch of potheads.""[128] Gil Troy's history of America in the 1990s states that in the Seattle grunge scene, the ""... drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine [of the 1980s] to blue-collar marijuana.""[129]Rolling Stone magazine reported that members of Seattle's grunge scene were ""coffee-crazed"" by day on espresso and ""... by night, they quaff[ed] oceans of beer – jolted by Java and looped with liquor, no wonder the [grunge] music sounds like it does.""[130] ""Some [Seattle] scene veterans maintain that MDA"", a drug related to Ecstasy, ""was a vital contributor to grunge"", because it gave users a ""body high"" (in contrast to marijuana's ""head high"") that made them appreciate ""bass-heavy grooves"".[131] Pat Long's  History of the NME states that scene members involved with the Sub Pop label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls Ecstasy's ""warm glow"" had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.[132]

Regarding graphic design and images, a common feature of grunge bands was the use of ""lo-fi"" (low fidelity) and deliberately unconventional album covers, for example presenting intentionally murky or miscolored photography, collage or distressed lettering. Early grunge ""[a]lbum covers and concert flyers appeared Xeroxed not in allegiance to some DIY aesthetic"" but because of ""economic necessity"", as ""bands had so little money"".[133] This was already a common feature of punk rock design, but could be extended in the grunge period due to the increasing use of Macintosh computers for desktop publishing and digital image processing. The style was sometimes called 'grunge typography' when used outside music.[134][135][136] A famous example of 'grunge'-style experimental design was Ray Gun magazine, art directed by David Carson.[137][138]

Carson developed a technique of ""ripping, shredding and remaking letters""[137][138]  and using ""overprinted, disharmonious letters"" and experimental design approaches, including ""deliberate 'mistakes' in alignment"".[139] Carson's art used ""messy and chaotic design"" and he did not ""respect any rule of composition"", using an ""experimental, personal and intuitive"" approach.[140] Another ""grunge graphic designer"" was Elliott Earls, who used ""distorted ... older typefaces"" and ""aggressively illegible"" type which adopted the ""unkempt expressiveness"" of the ""grunge [music] aesthetic""; this radical, anti-establishment approach in graphic design was influenced by the 1910s-era avant-garde Dada movement.[139] Hat Nguyen's Droplet, Harriet Goren's Morire and Eric Lin's Tema Canante were all ""signature grunge fonts.""[137][138] Sven Lennartz states that grunge design images have a ""realistic, genuine look"" which is created by adding simulated torn paper, dog-eared corners, creases, yellowed scotch tape, coffee cup stains, hand-drawn images and handwritten words, typically over a ""dirty"" background texture which is done with dull, subdued colors.[141]

A key figure in creating the ""look"" of the grunge scene for outsiders was music photographer Charles Peterson. Peterson's black and white, uncropped, and sometimes blurry shots of the underground Pacific Northwest music scene's members playing and jamming, wearing their characteristic everyday clothes, were used by Sub Pop to promote its Seattle bands.

Following the tradition in the 1980s US punk subculture of amateur, fan-produced zines, members of the grunge scene also produced DIY publications which were ""distributed at gigs or by mail order"". The zines were typically photocopied and contained handwritten, ""hand-colored pages"", ""typing errors and grammatical mistakes, misspellings and jumbled pagination"", all proof of their amateur nature.[142]Backlash was a zine that was published from 1987 to 1991 by Dawn Anderson, covering the ""dirtier, heavier, more underground and rock side of Seattle's music scene"", including ""punk, metal, underground rock, grunge before it was called grunge and even some local hip-hop.""[143]Grunge Gerl #1 was one early 1990s grunge zine, was written by and for riot grrrls in the Los Angeles area. It stated that ""we're girls, we're angry, we're powerful.""[142]

In 1992, Rolling Stone music critic Michael Azerrad called The Rocket the Seattle music ""scene's [most] respected commentator"".[57]The Rocket was a free newspaper about the Pacific Northwest music scene which was launched in 1979. Edited by Charles R. Cross, the paper covered ""fairly obscure alternative bands"" in the local area, such as the Fartz and others.[144] In the mid-1980s, the paper had stories on Slayer, Wild Dogs, Queensrÿche, and Metal Church.  By 1988, the metal scene had faded, and The Rocket's focus shifted to covering the pre-grunge local alternative rock bands. Dawn Anderson states that in 1988, long before any other publication took notice of them, Soundgarden and Nirvana were Rocket cover stars.[145]  In 1991, The Rocket expanded to include a Portland, Oregon edition.

Grunge lit is an Australian literary genre of fictional or semi-autobiographical writing in the early 1990s about young adults living in an ""inner cit[y]"" ""... world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from ... boredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol"".[146] Often the central characters are disfranchised, alienated, and lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by ""new, young authors""[146] who examined ""gritty, dirty, real existences""[146] of everyday characters.  It has been described as both a sub-set of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature.[147] Stuart Glover states that the term ""grunge lit"" takes the term ""grunge"" from the ""late '80s and early '90s— ... Seattle [grunge] bands"".[148] Glover states that the term ""grunge lit"" was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies; he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as ""grunge lit"" writers reject the label.[148] The Australian fiction authors McGahan, McGregor and Tsiolkas criticized the ""homogenizing effect"" of conflating such a different group of writers.[146] Tsiolkas called the ""grunge lit"" term a ""media creation"".[146]

Many all-female or woman-led bands are associated with grunge including L7, Lunachicks, Dickless, 7 Year Bitch, the Gits, Courtney Love's band Hole, and Babes in Toyland. VH1 writer Dan Tucker described L7 as an ""all-female grunge band [that] emanated from the fertile L.A. underground scene and [which] had strong ties with ... Black Flag and could match any male band in attitude and volume.""[35] Grunge was also closely linked with Riot Grrrl, an underground feminist punk movement.[149] 
Riot Grrrl pioneer and Bikini Kill frontwoman Kathleen Hanna was the source for the name of Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough single, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", a reference to a deodorant marketed specifically to young women.[150][151] Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists D'arcy Wretzky and Melissa Auf der Maur from the Smashing Pumpkins, and drummers Patty Schemel of Hole and Lori Barbero of Babes in Toyland.[152] The inclusion of women instrumentalists in grunge is notable, because professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in most rock genres.[153]

Bam Bam,[154] formed in Seattle in 1983, was fronted by an African American woman named Tina Bell, breaking the norm of what was predominantly a White dominated scene.[155][156][157] Bam Bam also included future Soundgarden and Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron.[154]Kurt Cobain was a roadie for Bam Bam before he was famous and was also a fan of the band.[154] Bell died in 2012. Observers have speculated that the lack of recognition in her lifetime as one of the progenitors of grunge music was due to sexism and racism.[154][155][157]

Women also played active non-musician roles in the underground grunge scene, such as riot grrrls who produced zines about grunge bands and indie record labels (e.g., Grunge Gerl #1) and writer Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash which supported many local bands before they achieved greater fame.[37] Tina Casale was the co-founder of C/Z Records in the 1980s (along with Chris Hanzsek), a Seattle indie label that released the seminal grunge compilation Deep Six in 1986.

Susan Silver was the first female manager of the Seattle music scene. She started her career in 1983 and managed several bands such as the U-Men, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Screaming Trees.[158] In 1991, The Seattle Times called Silver ""the most powerful figure in local rock management"".[159] Silver was also an advisor for Nirvana. Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic consulted Silver for advice when they were not satisfied with Sub Pop's lack of promotion for their debut album, Bleach. Silver looked at their contract with the label and told them they needed a lawyer. Silver then introduced them to agent Don Muller and music business attorney Alan Mintz, who started sending out Nirvana's demo tape to major labels looking for deals. The band ended up choosing DGC and the label released their breakthrough album Nevermind in 1991.[160][161] When Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, Novoselic thanked Silver during his speech for ""introducing them to the music industry properly"".[162]

The term proto-grunge has been used to describe artists as having elements of grunge well before the genre appeared in the mid- to late-1980s. Perhaps the earliest proto-grunge album is Here Are the Sonics, released in 1965 by the Sonics.[163]Neil Young's albums Rust Never Sleeps (1979) and Ragged Glory (1990) have been proclaimed examples of proto-grunge and grunge music.[164] Additionally, he has been cited as an influence by Pearl Jam,[165][166] which led to them backing Young for the Mirror Ball album, released in 1995. Other acts described as proto-grunge include Wipers and their album Youth of America (1981), Elvis Costello and his Blood & Chocolate album which Will Birch hailed as ""6 or 8 years ahead of its time"" (1986),[167] and the Stooges and their album Fun House (1970).[168]

Grunge's sound partly resulted from Seattle's isolation from other music scenes. As Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman noted, ""Seattle was a perfect example of a secondary city with an active music scene that was completely ignored by an American media fixated on Los Angeles and New York [City].""[169] Mark Arm claimed that the isolation meant, ""this one corner of the map was being really inbred and ripping off each other's ideas"".[170] Seattle ""was a remote and provincial city"" in the 1980s; Bruce Pavitt states that the city was ""very working class"", a place of deprivation, and so the scene's ""whole aesthetic – work clothes, thriftstore truckers' hats, pawnshop guitars"" was not just a style, it was done because Seattle ""was very poor.""[171] Indeed, when ""Nevermind reached number one in the U.S. charts, Cobain was living in a car.""[171]

Bands began to mix metal and punk in the Seattle music scene around 1984, with much of the credit for this fusion going to the U-Men.[172] However, some critics have noted that in spite of the U-Men's canonical place as original grunge progenitors, that their sound was less indebted to heavy metal and much more akin to post-punk. However the idiosyncrasy of the band may have been the bigger inspiration, more than the aesthetics themselves.[173] Soon Seattle had a growing and ""varied music scene"" and ""diverse urban personality"" expressed by local ""post-punk garage bands"".[33] Grunge evolved from the local punk rock scene, and was inspired by bands such as the Fartz, the U-Men, 10 Minute Warning, the Accüsed, and the Fastbacks.[37] Additionally, the slow, heavy, and sludgy style of the Melvins was a significant influence on the grunge sound.[174] Roy Shuker states that grunge's success built on the ""foundations ... laid throughout the 1980s by earlier alternative music scenes.""[175] Shuker states that music critics ""... emphasized the perceived purity and authenticity of the Seattle scene.[175]

Outside the Pacific Northwest, a number of artists and music scenes influenced grunge. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth ""inadvertently nurtured"" the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians.[176] Nirvana introduced into the Seattle scene the noise-inflected influences of Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers.[83][177]

Several Australian bands, including the Scientists, Cosmic Psychos and Feedtime, are cited as precursors to grunge, their music influencing the Seattle scene through the college radio broadcasts of Sub Pop founder Jonathan Poneman and members of Mudhoney on KCMU.[178][179] The influence of Pixies on Nirvana was noted by Kurt Cobain, who commented in a Rolling Stone interview, ""I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.""[180] In August 1997, in an interview with Guitar World, Dave Grohl said: ""From Kurt, Krist [Novoselic] and I liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles and Abba just as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag ... You listen to any Pixies record and it's all over there. Or even Black Sabbath's ""War Pigs""—it's there: the power of the dynamic. We just sort of abused it with pop songs and got sick with it.""[181]

Aside from the genre's punk and alternative rock roots, many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal of the early 1970s. Clinton Heylin, author of Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge, cited Black Sabbath as ""perhaps the most ubiquitous pre-punk influence on the northwest scene"".[182] Black Sabbath played a role in shaping the grunge sound, through their own records and the records they inspired.[183] Musicologist Bob Gulla asserted that Black Sabbath's sound ""shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains"".[184] Black Sabbath's 1971 album Master of Reality in particular has been noted as a key influence on grunge, largely in part due to the sound, as a result of guitarist Tony Iommi down-tuning his guitar a step and a half.[185][186] The influence of Led Zeppelin is also evident, particularly in the work of Soundgarden, whom Q magazine noted were ""in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo"".[187] Jon Wiederhorn of Guitar World wrote: ""So what exactly is grunge? ... Picture a supergroup made up of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath and the Stooges, and you're pretty close.""[188] Catherine Strong stated that grunge's strongest metal influence was thrash metal, which had a tradition of ""equality with the audience"", based on the notion that ""anyone could start a band"" (a way of thinking also shared by US hardcore punk, which Strong also cites as an influence on grunge) which was also taken up by grunge bands.[16] Strong stated that grunge musicians were opposed to the then-popular ""hair metal"" bands.[16]

Strong stated that ""sections of what was [US] hardcore became known as grunge.""[16] Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that ""[t]here is no real difference ... between Punk and Grunge.""[24] Like punk bands, grunge groups were ""embraced as back-to-basics rock 'n' roll bands which reminded the public that the music was supposed to be raw and raunchy"".[93] One example of the influence of US hardcore on grunge is the impact that the Los Angeles hardcore punk band Black Flag had on grunge. Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle. Mudhoney's Steve Turner commented, ""A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great ... we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding.""[189] Turner explained grunge's integration of metal influences, noting, ""Hard rock and metal was never that much of an enemy of punk like it was for other scenes. Here, it was like, 'There's only twenty people here, you can't really find a group to hate.'"" Charles R. Cross stated that grunge was the ""culmination of twenty years of punk rock"" development.[34] Cross states that the bands most representing the grunge genre were Seattle bands Blood Circus, Tad, and Mudhoney and Sub Pop's Denver band the Fluid; he states that Nirvana, with its pop influences and blend of Sonic Youth and Cheap Trick, was lighter-sounding than bands like Blood Circus.[34]

Neil Young played a few concerts with Pearl Jam and recorded the album Mirror Ball. This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also his dress and persona.[190] A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, ""Neurotica was a life changer for me and for a lot of people in the Seattle music community.""[191]

The context for the development of the Seattle grunge scene was a ""golden age of failure, a time when a swath of American youth embraced the ... vices of indolence and lack of motivation"".[171] The ""idlers of Generation X [were] trying to forestall the dread day of corporate enrollment"" and embrace the ""cult of the loser""; indeed Nirvana's 1991 song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" ""opens with Cobain intoning 'It's fun to lose.'""[171]

In 1985, the band Green River released their debut EP Come on Down, which is cited by many as being the first grunge record.[192] Another seminal release in the development of grunge was the Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records in 1986. The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and the U-Men. For many of them it was their first appearance on record. The artists had ""a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore"". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, ""People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it?' ... People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'""[189] Later that year Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation and Green River's Dry As a Bone EP as part of his new label, Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as ""ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation"".[193] Sub Pop's Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, inspired by other regional music scenes in music history, worked to ensure that their label projected a ""Seattle sound"", reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging. While music writer Michael Azerrad acknowledged that early grunge bands like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Tad had disparate sounds, he noted ""to the objective observer, there were some distinct similarities.""[194]

Early grunge concerts were sparsely attended (many by fewer than a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create the impression that such concerts were major events.[195] Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement.[196] Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.[37]

Grunge attracted media attention in the United Kingdom after Pavitt and Poneman asked journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker to write an article on the local music scene. This exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows.[37] The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it ""promised the return to a notion of a regional, authorial vision for American rock"".[197] Grunge's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands. Mudhoney's Steve Turner said, ""It was really bad. Pretend bands were popping up here, things weren't coming from where we were coming from.""[198] As a reaction, many grunge bands diversified their sound, with Nirvana and Tad in particular creating more melodic songs.[199] Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the Seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated.[37]

Chris Dubrow from The Guardian states that in the late 1980s, Australia's ""sticky-floored ... alternative pub scene"" in seedy inner-city areas produced grunge bands with ""raw and awkward energy"" such as the Scientists, X, Beasts of Bourbon, feedtime, Cosmic Psychos and Lubricated Goat.[200] Dubrow said ""Cobain ... admitted the Australian wave was a big influence"" on his music.[200] Everett True states that ""[t]here's more of an argument to be had for grunge beginning in Australia with the Scientists and their scrawny punk ilk.""[201]

Grunge bands had made inroads to the musical mainstream in the late 1980s. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when they joined the roster of A&M Records in 1989. Soundgarden, along with other major label signings Alice in Chains and Mother Love Bone, performed ""okay"" with their initial major label releases, according to Jack Endino.[37]Nirvana, originally from Aberdeen, Washington, was also courted by major labels, while releasing its first album Bleach in 1989. Nirvana got signed by Geffen Records in 1990.

Alice in Chains signed with Columbia Records in 1989,[202] and their debut album, Facelift, was released on August 21, 1990.[203] The album's second single, ""Man in the Box"", was released in January 1991, spent 20 weeks on the Top 20 of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and its music video received heavy rotation on MTV.[204][205]Facelift became the first album from the grunge movement to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 11, 1991,[206] for selling over 500,000 copies.[207]

In September 1991, Nirvana released its major label debut, Nevermind. The album was at best hoped to be a minor success on par with Sonic Youth's Goo, which Geffen had released a year earlier.[208] It was the release of the album's first single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" that ""marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon"". Due to the constant airplay of the song's music video on MTV, Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991,[209] and was certified gold on November 27, 1991.[210] In January 1992, Nevermind replaced pop superstar Michael Jackson's Dangerous at number one on the Billboard 200.[211]Nevermind was certified diamond by the RIAA in 1999.[212]

The success of Nevermind surprised the music industry. Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established ""the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.""[213] Michael Azerrad asserted that Nevermind symbolized ""a sea-change in rock music"" in which the glam metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was perceived as authentic and culturally relevant.[214] Grunge made it possible for genres thought to be of a niche audience, no matter how radical, to prove their marketability and be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture.[215] Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. Pearl Jam, which featured former Mother Love Bone members Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, had released its debut album Ten in August 1991, a month before Nevermind, but album sales only picked up the following year. By the second half of 1992 Ten had become a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts.[216]Ten by Pearl Jam was certified 13× platinum by the RIAA.[217]

The band Soundgarden's album Badmotorfinger and the band Alice in Chains' album Dirt, along with the band Temple of the Dog's self-titled album, a collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top selling albums of 1992.[218] The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle ""the new Liverpool"".[82] Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success.[219] The grunge scene was the backdrop in the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles. There were several small roles, performances, and cameos in the film by popular Seattle grunge bands including Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. Filmed in and around Seattle in 1991, the film was not released until 1992 during the height of grunge popularity.[82]

The popularity of grunge resulted in a large interest in the Seattle music scene's perceived cultural traits. While the Seattle music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s in actuality consisted of various styles and genres of music, its representation in the media ""served to depict Seattle as a music 'community' in which the focus was upon the ongoing exploration of one musical idiom, namely grunge"".[220] The fashion industry marketed ""grunge fashion"" to consumers, charging premium prices for items such as knit ski hats and tartan shirts. Critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. Entertainment Weekly commented in a 1993 article, ""There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s"".[221] Marketers used the ""grunge"" concept to sell grunge air freshener, grunge hair gel and even CDs of ""easy-listening music"" called ""grunge light"".[34]The New York Times compared the ""grunging of America"" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years.[82] Ironically, the New York Times was tricked into printing a fake list of slang terms that were supposedly used in the grunge scene; often referred to as the grunge speak hoax. This media hype surrounding grunge was documented in the 1996 documentary Hype!.[37] As mass media began to use the term ""grunge"" in any news story about the key bands, Seattle scene members began to refer to the term as ""the G-word"".[34]

A backlash against grunge began to develop in Seattle; in late 1992, Jonathan Poneman said that in the city, ""All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [. . .] Because the whole thing is a fabricated movement and always has been.""[82] Grunge and grunge bands received criticism from musicians such as Blur's Damon Albarn, who was quoted saying ""fuck grunge"" and ""The Smashing Pumpkins can kiss my fucking ass"" while performing onstage.[222] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, ""Famous is the last thing I wanted to be.""[223] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.[224]

Nirvana's follow-up album In Utero (1993) featured an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a ""wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record"".[225] Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993, In Utero topped the Billboard charts.[226] In 1996, In Utero was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA.[227] Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, Vs. (1993). The album sold a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release, topped the Billboard charts, and outperformed all other entries in the top ten that week combined.[228] In 1993, the grunge band Candlebox released their self-titled album, which was certified 4× platinum by the RIAA.[229] In February 1994, Alice in Chains' EP, Jar of Flies peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.[230] Soundgarden's album Superunknown, which was also released in 1994, peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart,[231] and was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA.[232] In 1995, Alice in Chains' self-titled album became their second number 1 album on the Billboard 200,[230] and was certified 2× platinum.[233]

At the height of grunge's commercial success in the early 1990s, the commercial success of grunge put record labels on a nationwide search for undiscovered talent to promote. This included San Diego, California-based Stone Temple Pilots,[234] Texas-based Tripping Daisy[8][better source needed][235] and Toadies,[236][237][238]Paw,[239] Chicago-based Veruca Salt,[239] and Australian band Silverchair, bands whose early work continues to be identified broadly (if not in Seattle itself) as ""grunge"". In 2014, Paste ranked Veruca Salt's ""All Hail Me"" #39 and Silverchair's ""Tomorrow"" #45 on their list of the 50 best grunge songs of all time.[239]Loudwire named Stone Temple Pilots one of the ten best grunge bands of all time.[234] Grunge bands outside of the United States emerged in several countries. In Canada, Eric's Trip, the first Canadian band signed by the Sub Pop label, has been classified as grunge[240] and Nickelback's debut album was considered to be grunge. Silverchair achieved mainstream success in the 1990s; the band's song ""Tomorrow"" went to number 22 on the Radio Songs chart in September 1995[241] and the band's debut album Frogstomp, released in June 1995, was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in February 1996.[242]

During this period, grunge bands that were not from Seattle were often panned by critics, who accused them of being bandwagon-jumpers. Grunge band Stone Temple Pilots in particular fell victim to this. In a January 1994 Rolling Stone poll, Stone Temple Pilots was simultaneously voted ""Best New Band"" by Rolling Stone's readers and ""Worst New Band"" by the magazine's music critics, highlighting the disparity between critics and fans.[243] Stone Temple Pilots became very popular; their album Core was certified 8× platinum by RIAA[244] and their album Purple was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.[245] The British grunge band Bush released their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994.[246] In a review of their second album Razorblade Suitcase, Rolling Stone criticized the album and called Bush ""the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's music"".[247] In the book Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota, Chuck Klosterman wrote, ""Bush was a good band who just happened to signal the beginning of the end; ultimately, they would become the grunge Warrant"".[248]

A number of factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. Critics and historians do not agree on the exact point that grunge ended.[249] Catherine Strong wrote that ""at the end of 1993 ... grunge had become unstable, and was entering the first stages of being killed off""; she pointed out that the ""scene had become so successful"" and widely known that ""imitators had begun to enter the field"".[250]Paste magazine states by 1994, grunge ""was fading fast"", with ""Pearl Jam retreating from the spotlight as fast as they could; Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and hordes of others were battling horrid drug addictions and struggling for survival.""[9] In Grunge: Seattle, Justin Henderson stated that the ""downward spiral"" began in mid-1994, as the influx of major label money into the scene changed the culture and it had ""nowhere to go but down""; he states the death of Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff on June 16, 1994, from a heroin overdose, was ""another nail in grunge's coffin.""[251]

In Jason Heller's 2013 article ""Did grunge really matter?"", in The A.V. Club, he stated that Nirvana's In Utero (September 1993) was ""grunge's death knell. As soon as Cobain grumbled, 'Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I'm bored and old,' it was all over.""[252] Heller states that after Cobain's death in 1994, the ""hypocrisy"" in the grunge of the time ""became ... glaring"" and ""idealism became embarrassing"", with the result being that ""grunge became the new [mainstream] Aerosmith"".[252] Heller states that ""grunge became an evolutionary dead end"", because ""it stood for nothing and was built on nothing, and that ethos of negation was all it was about.""[252]

During the mid-1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound; Nirvana summarily disbanded. After Cobain's death, Bruce Hardy wrote in Time magazine that he was ""the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest"", that he had struggled with a heroin addiction, and claimed that during the last weeks of his life there had been rumors in the music industry that Cobain had suffered a drug overdose and that Nirvana was breaking up.[253] Cobain's suicide ""served as a catalyst for grunge's ... demise"", because it ""deflated the energy from grunge and provided the opening for saccharine and corporate-formulated music to regain"" its lost footing.""[254]

That same year Pearl Jam canceled its summer tour in protest of ticket vendor Ticketmaster's unfair business practices.[255] Pearl Jam then began a boycott of the company; however, Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented the band from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.[256] In 1996, Alice in Chains gave their final performances with their ailing and estranged lead singer, Layne Staley,[257] who subsequently died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin in 2002.[258] In 1996, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees released their final studio albums of the 1990s, Down on the Upside[259] and Dust,[260] respectively. Strong states that Roy Shuker and Stout have written that the ""end of grunge"" can be seen as being ""as late as the breakup of Soundgarden in 1997"".[250]

During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge, which remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century. Post-grunge ""... transformed the thick guitar sounds and candid lyrical themes of the Seattle bands into an accessible, often uplifting mainstream aesthetic"".[261] These artists were seen as lacking the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely ""a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock"". Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.[262][better source needed][263] When grunge became a mainstream genre, major labels started signing bands that sounded similar to these bands' sonic identities. Bands labeled as post-grunge that emerged when grunge was mainstream such as Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul all are noted for emulating the sound of the bands that launched grunge into the mainstream.[262][better source needed]

In 1995, SPIN writer Charles Aaron stated that with grunge ""spent"", pop punk in a slump, Britpop a ""giddy memory"" and album-oriented rock over, the music industry turned to ""Corporate[-produced] Alternative"", which he calls ""soundalike fake grunge"" or ""scrunge"".[264] Bands Aaron lists as ""scrunge"" groups include: Better Than Ezra; Bush; Collective Soul; Garbage; Hootie & the Blowfish; Hum; Silverchair; Sponge; Tripping Daisy; Jennifer Trynin and Weezer; Aaron includes the Foo Fighters in his list, but states that Dave Grohl avoided becoming a ""scrunge fall gu[y]"" by combining 1980s hardcore punk with 1970s arena trash music in his post-Nirvana group.[264] Bands described as grunge like Bush[265][266][267] and Candlebox[268] also have been largely categorized as post-grunge.[263] These two bands became popular after 1992.[263] Other bands categorized as post-grunge that emerged when Bush and Candlebox became popular include Collective Soul[262][better source needed] and Live.[269]

Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, emerged in part as a reaction against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by ""youthful exuberance and desire for recognition"".[270][better source needed] The leading Britpop bands, ""Blur and Oasis existed as reactionary forces to [grunge's] eternal downcast glare.""[271] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, ""Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.""[272]

Britpop artists were vocal about their disdain for grunge. In a 1993 NME interview, Damon Albarn of Britpop band Blur agreed with interviewer John Harris' assertion that Blur was an ""anti-grunge band"", and said, ""Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge"" (ironically Kurt Cobain once cited Blur as his favorite band).[273]Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single ""Live Forever"" ""was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' and I was like ... 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [Cobain] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack [heroin], fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish.""[274] In an interview during Pinkpop Festival 2000, Oasis' Liam Gallagher attacked Pearl Jam, who were also performing, criticizing their depressing lyrical content and writing them off as ""rubbish"".[275]

Following the end of the original grunge movement, post-grunge increased in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s with newer bands such as Creed, Nickelback, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd.[262][better source needed] Other post-grunge bands include Foo Fighters, Staind and Matchbox Twenty. These post-grunge artists were criticized for their commercialized sound as well as their ""worldview built around the comforts of community and romantic relationships"", as opposed to grunge's lyrical exploration of ""troubling issues such as suicide, societal hypocrisy and drug addiction.""[262][better source needed] Adam Steininger criticized post-grunge bands' ""diluted ditties filled with watered-down lyrics, all seemingly revolving around suffering through romance.""[276] Criticizing many bands that have been described as post-grunge, Steininger criticized Candlebox for their ""pop-filled"" sound, focus on ""love lyrics, and writing songs without ""versatility and creativity; Three Days Grace for their ""diluted"" and ""radio-friendly music""; 3 Doors Down for focusing on ""snagging hit singles instead of creating quality albums""; Finger Eleven for going in a ""pop rock"" direction; Bush's ""random phrasings of nonsense""; Live's ""pseudo pop poetry"" that ""strangled the essence of grunge"", Puddle of Mudd's ""watered down post-grunge sound""; Lifehouse, for tearing down ""grunge's sound and groundbreaking structure to appeal more to the masses""; and Nickelback, which he calls the ""featherweight ... punching bags of post-grunge"" whose music is ""dull as dishwater"".[276]

Many major grunge bands continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s and 2010s. Perhaps the most notable grunge act of the 21st century has been Pearl Jam. In 2006 Rolling Stone writer Brian Hiatt described Pearl Jam as having ""spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame"", he noted the band developed a loyal concert following akin to that of the Grateful Dead.[277] They saw a return to wide commercial success with 2006's Pearl Jam, 2009's Backspacer and 2013's Lightning Bolt.[278] Alice In Chains reformed for a handful of reunion dates in 2005 with several different vocalists replacing Layne Staley. Eventually settling on William DuVall as Staley's replacement, in 2009 they released Black Gives Way to Blue, their first record in 14 years. The band's 2013 release, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, reached number 2 on the Billboard 200.[279] Soundgarden reformed in 2010 and released their album King Animal two years later which reached the top five of the national albums charts in Denmark, New Zealand, and the United States.[280] Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd joined Alain Johannes (Queens of the Stone Age, Eleven), Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age) and Dimitri Coats (Off!) to form side project Ten Commandos in 2016.[281]

Despite Kurt Cobain's death, the remaining members of Nirvana have continued to be successful posthumously. Due to the high sales for Kurt Cobain's Journals and the band's best-of compilation Nirvana upon their releases in 2002, The New York Times argued Nirvana ""are having more success now than at any point since Mr. Cobain's suicide in 1994.""[282] This trend has continued through the century's second decade, with the reissuing of the band's discography and release of the authorized documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck.[283] In 2012, the surviving members of Nirvana re-united, with Paul McCartney in place of Cobain, to record a track for the soundtrack Dave Grohl's documentary Sound City titled ""Cut Me Some Slack"".[284]

One of the most successful rock groups of the 21st century, Queens of the Stone Age, has featured major contributions from various grunge musicians. Josh Homme had briefly played in Screaming Trees with off-and-on QOTSA member Mark Lanegan, before forming the group. Nirvana's Dave Grohl and Eleven's Alain Johannes have also provided notable contributions. Homme and Grohl joined with Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones to form the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures in 2009. Johannes also performed with the group as a touring member.

In the early 2000s, grunge would make multiple regionally based resurgences, albeit minor ones. In 2005, The Seattle Times made note of grunge-influenced groups returning in the Seattle scene.[285] Similarly, The Guardian reported of grunge-influenced groups from Yorkshire, including Dinosaur Pile-Up, Pulled Apart by Horses, and Wonderswan.[286] Also, in 2003, the New York Times noted a resurgence in grunge fashion.[287]

The 2010s have birthed a number of bands influenced by grunge. Unlike their forebears, some of these acts ascribe the label to themselves willingly. Many acts have been noted for affiliating and/or collaborating with prominent figures from the original alternative rock era. Steve Albini has produced for or worked with members of bands such as Bully,[288][289] Vomitface,[290][291] and Shannon Wright,[292] while Emma Ruth Rundle of Marriages[293] has toured with Buzz Osborne of the Melvins. Other notable acts that have been labelled as grunge or as heavily influenced by the grunge era, include Courtney Barnett,[294][295]Wolf Alice,[296]Yuck,[297]Speedy Ortiz,[298]the Kut,[299]Mitski,[300]2:54,[301]False Advertising,[302]Slothrust,[303][304][305]Baby in Vain,[306]Big Thief,[307]Torres,[308] Lullwater,[309] and Red Sun Rising.[310]

Media outlets also began referring to a revival of the grunge sound around the mid-2010s, with the label being given to bands such as Title Fight,[311][312]InCrest,[313]Fangclub,[314]Code Orange,[312]My Ticket Home,[315][316]Citizen,[317]Milk Teeth[318] and Muskets,[319][320][321] some of which have been described as merging the genre with emo.[citation needed]

In 2011, music critic Dave Whitaker wrote, ""every generation since the beginning of recorded music has introduced a game-changing genre"", from swing music in the 1930s, rock and roll in the 1950s, punk rock in the 1970s, and then grunge in the 1990s. However, he states ""grunge was the last American musical revolution"", as no post-grunge generation has introduced a new genre which radically changed the music scene.[93] He states that the ""digital revolution"" (online music, file sharing, etc.) has meant that there has not been a ""generation-defining genre since grunge"", because, for ""one genre to so completely saturate the market requires ... a music industry with immense control over the market"".[93] In 2016, Rob Zombie stated that grunge caused the death of the ""rock star""; he states that unlike previous stars like ""Alice Cooper and Gene Simmons and Elton John"", who ""might as well have been from another fuckin' planet"", with grunge the attitude was ""[we] need all our rock stars to look just like us.""[322]

Bob Batchelor states that the indie record mindset and values in Seattle which provided guidance for the development and emergence of Nirvana and Pearl Jam ""conflicted with the major recording label desire to sell millions of CDs."" Batchelor also states that despite grunge musicians' discomfort with the major labels' commercial goals, and the resistance by some key bands to do the promotional activities required by the labels, including music videos, MTV's video programs ""played an instrumental role in making [grunge]"" become ""mainstream, since many music fans received their first exposure"" on MTV, rather than on local or ""niche radio.""[254] Gil Troy states that the ""grunge rebellion, like most others"" in America's ""consumerist"" culture, ended up being ""commodified, mass-produced, ritualized, and thus sanitized"" by major corporations.[323]

In 2011, John Calvert stated that ""timing"" is the reason why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the cultural mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present.[324] Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the ""context and history of how it all came to be"" and ""respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [in Seattle,] because you probably won't see anything like it again.""[24]Paste magazine's Michael Danaher states that the grunge ""movement changed the course of rock 'n' roll, bringing ... tales of abuse and depression"" and socially conscious issues"" into pop culture.[9]

Calvert stated that Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" has an ""iconic place in history"" as it had ""generation-defining resonance"" for young people from its era""; he states that ""no other band ... made the urge to self-destruct ... as listenable"", with ""authentic"" pain and ""disaffection"".[324] Calvert also calls the record ""chart history's most ferocious, dark and intense"" music since early punk rock, and he says it was ""heavy when heavy was needed"" by young people of that era, ""jarr[ing] young America awake"" and giving them something to ""cling to"" in difficult times.[324] A 2017 book stated that grunge ""forever changed the identity of rock music in a way analogous to punk""; moreover, grunge added ""introspective"" lyrics about ""existential authenticity"" and ""what it means to be true to oneself"".[10] Grunge's Kurt Cobain has been called the ""voice of Generation X"", playing the same role for this demographic as Bob Dylan played for 1960s youth and that John Lennon played for the 1970s generation.[10] Bob Batchelor stated that Nirvana was ""as important as Elvis or the Beatles.""[254]

In 2008, Darragh McManus of The Guardian states that grunge was not simply a young person's trend or a musical fad; she states that grunge synthesized the key philosophies of the modern era, from ""Feminism, liberalism, irony, apathy, cynicism/idealism ... anti-authoritarianism, [to] wry post-modernism"". McManus states that grunge dealt with serious, ""weighty"" topics, which does not occur often in popular music. McManus stated that for Generation X, grunge was not just music, it was a key cultural influence.[325] Marlen Komar stated that Nirvana's success popularized ""non-heterosexist"", non-binary ways of thinking about ""gender and sexuality"", emphasized how men and women were alike and promoted progressive political thinking.[104]

When asked about the '90s grunge movement in 2021, Mark Lanegan commented, ""It's not something that was contrived or cooked up around the campfire somewhere. It just happened organically. It's hard for me to comment, because there's always great new music and there probably always will be – as long as the sun keeps shining.""[326]"
"Post-grunge","

Post-grunge is an offshoot of grunge that has a less abrasive or intense tone than traditional grunge. Originally, the term was used almost pejoratively to label mid-1990s rock bands such as Bush, Candlebox, Collective Soul, Live, Foo Fighters, and Silverchair, that emulated the original sound of grunge.

In the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed into a more clearly defined style that combined the sound and aesthetic of grunge with more commercially accessible songwriting, rising to prominence that lasted into the 2000s. Bands such as Foo Fighters, Nickelback, Creed, Staind, Puddle of Mudd, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Shinedown, Seether, and Matchbox Twenty achieved mainstream success in this second wave.

During the 1990s, a post-grunge sound emerged that emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitars, but with a less intense and less abrasive tone.[1][2] Unlike a lot of early grunge bands, post-grunge bands often worked through major record labels and incorporated influences from a variety of musical genres such as jangle pop, pop-punk, ska revival, alternative metal, and classic rock.[2] Post-grunge music tends to be in mid-tempo and is noted for having ""a polished, radio-ready production"".[2] Tim Grierson of About.com wrote that musically, post-grunge bands ""split the difference between plaintive ballads and aggressive rockers, resulting in songs that combine the two extremes into a sad-eyed, propulsive middle ground"".[3] Post-grunge tends to feature the ""...same kind of melody as...bubblegum pop"" and pop song structures.[4][5] On some occasions, post-grunge music features both an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar playing simultaneously.[4] Post-grunge tends to have production quality that is much higher and cleaner than grunge.[6]

A ""major rift"" between grunge and post-grunge is in the lyrical substance of the music; grunge often expressed emotion through loose metaphors or third-person narratives, while post-grunge was known for being direct and blunt.[4] While describing lyrics that are common in post-grunge, Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound wrote that post-grunge ""plunged directly into the 'I.' ""[4] Geffen also wrote that most post-grunge songs that achieved mainstream success ""call after a prospective or past companion in the first person"".[4] Post-grunge lyrics also tend to be about topics such as relationships, romance and drug addiction.[4][7] According to Geffen, ""grunge's frontmen posed with their addictions; post-grunge's songwriters sought redemption for them"".[4] Geffen then states that post-grunge songs ""fit the mold of songs made for...teenage boys and girls"" who were ""longing for a distant someone"".[4]

Originally, post-grunge was a label that was meant to be almost pejorative, suggesting that grunge bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an ""authentic"" rock movement.[1] When grunge became a mainstream genre because of bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, record labels started signing bands that sounded similar to these bands' sonic identities. Bands labeled as post-grunge that emerged when grunge was mainstream such as Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul are all noted for emulating the sound of bands that launched grunge into the mainstream.[1] According to Tim Grierson of About.com, the almost pejorative use of the ""post-grunge"" label to describe these bands was ""suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music"".[1] During the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed, becoming a derivative of grunge that combined characteristics of grunge with a more commercially accessible tone. During this time, post-grunge bands such as Creed and Nickelback emerged. Grierson wrote: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}

Creed and Nickelback espoused a more conventional, almost conservative worldview built around the comforts of community and romantic relationships. Ironically, this attitude was diametrically opposed to the antisocial angst of the original grunge bands, who railed against conformity and instead explored troubling issues such as suicide, societal hypocrisy and drug addiction.[1]

Grierson also wrote, ""Post-grunge was a profitable musical style, but bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were beloved partly because of their perceived integrity in avoiding the mainstream. Post-grunge, by comparison, seemed to exist in order to court that very audience.""[1]

In the late 2000s and 2010s, the derogatory term ""butt rock"" gained traction when applied in relation to many post-grunge artists who were popular during the genre's prime, such as Nickelback, Creed, Puddle of Mudd, and Hinder. While the origins of the term are debated, the term ""butt rock"" usually comes from someone critical of an overuse of raspy vocals (often described as imitations of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder) or, less often, overly clichéd or angsty lyrics.[9]

Even at the height of their popularity, after the release of Nevermind (1991) brought grunge to international attention, Nirvana experienced increasing problems, partly caused by Kurt Cobain's drug addiction and growing dissatisfaction with commercial success.[10] In late 1992, Cobain was photographed in a T-shirt with 'Grunge is Dead' printed on its front[11] at which point the genre's decline started to be widely discussed.[12][13]Cobain's suicide in 1994, as well as Pearl Jam's touring problems, marked a decline for grunge that year.[2] Problems of addiction for Layne Staley of Alice in Chains led to the band cancelling scheduled dates in 1995.[14] Addiction and legal problems for Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots led to the band having touring problems, causing the band to tour their album Purple for only four months, and their follow up album Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop for only 6 weeks.[15]

As the original grunge movement began to fade, major record labels began signing and promoting bands emulating the genre in a more mainstream style, dubbed by some writers as ""post-grunge"".[16] In spite of the fact that bands such as Bush[17][18][19] and Candlebox[20] have been categorized as grunge, both bands have also been categorized as post-grunge.[2] Collective Soul[1] and Live[7] are two other bands categorized as post-grunge that emerged along with Bush and Candlebox. Bush, Candlebox, Collective Soul and Live all achieved mainstream success; Candlebox's self-titled album (1993) was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)[21] and, according to Nielsen SoundScan, sold at least 4,000,000 copies.[22] Its song ""Far Behind"" peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100.[23] Collective Soul's song ""Shine"" peaked at number 11 on the same chart[24] and was certified gold by the RIAA in September 1994.[25] Collective Soul's album Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid (1993) was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA,[26] and the band's self-titled album released in 1995 was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA.[27] Bush's debut studio album Sixteen Stone (1994) was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA[28] and the band's second studio album Razorblade Suitcase (1996), which peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200,[29] was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA.[30] Carl Williott of Stereogum called Bush's album Sixteen Stone ""a harbinger of post-grunge's pop dominance"".[31] Live's album Throwing Copper (1994) was certified 8× platinum by the RIAA,[32] and the band's album Secret Samadhi (1997) was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA.[33] Both Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[34]

In 1995, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's newer band Foo Fighters helped to popularize post-grunge and define its parameters, becoming one of the most commercially successful rock bands in the United States, aided by considerable airplay on MTV.[35] Like grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, the post-grunge band Candlebox was from Seattle, but post-grunge was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands categorized as post-grunge such as York, Pennsylvania's Live,[36]Atlanta, Georgia's Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all paved the way for later post-grunge bands.[2][37] Female solo artist Alanis Morissette's 1995 album Jagged Little Pill, which is considered a post-grunge album, became a hit[38] and was certified 16× platinum by the RIAA in 1998[39]  having sold at least 15,000,000 copies in the United States.[40] Matchbox Twenty's 1996 debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You, was a success; it was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA.[41]

With the first wave of post-grunge bands losing popularity, post-grunge morphed in the late 1990s and 2000s, gaining further popularity with newer acts such as Creed, Nickelback, Three Days Grace, 3 Doors Down, Puddle of Mudd, Staind,[42]Hinder, Audioslave,[43]Hoobastank,[44]Fuel, Breaking Benjamin, Shinedown, Seether,[1] and Daughtry,[45] abandoning some of the angst and anger of the earlier artists for more conventional anthems, narratives, and romantic songs. Creed's albums My Own Prison, released in 1997, and Weathered, released in 2001, were both certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.[46][47]Weathered sold at least 6,400,000 copies in the United States.[48] Creed's album Human Clay, released in 1999, was certified diamond by the RIAA[49] and sold at least 11,690,000 copies in the United States.[50]Human Clay's song ""With Arms Wide Open"" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.[51]

Nickelback broke into the mainstream in the early 2000s; their song ""How You Remind Me"" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.[52] The Nickelback album that featured the song, Silver Side Up, was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA[53] and sold at least 5,528,000 copies in the United States.[54] Nickelback's next album, The Long Road, was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA[55] and sold at least 3,591,000 copies in the United States.[54] The album's song ""Someday"" peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Canadian Singles Chart and the Adult Top 40 chart.[52] Nickelback's album All the Right Reasons was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA fourteen months after being released. Four years after being released, the album was certified 8× platinum by the RIAA. In March 2017, All the Right Reasons was certified diamond by the RIAA.[56] Staind's album Break the Cycle peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200[57] and sold at least 716,000 copies in its release week,[58] and, according to Nielsen SoundScan, sold at least 4,240,000 copies in 2001.[59]Break the Cycle's song ""It's Been Awhile"" peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.[57]

3 Doors Down's debut studio album The Better Life was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA[60] and sold at least 5,653,000 copies in the United States.[61]The Better Life's song ""Kryptonite"" peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100[62] and number 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[63] 3 Doors Down's second studio album Away from the Sun was certified 4× platinum by the RIAA[64] and sold at least 3,863,000 copies in the United States.[65]Lifehouse achieved mainstream success in the early 2000s; their song ""Hanging by a Moment"", which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100,[66] was the most played song on the radio in 2001.[67] Puddle of Mudd broke into the mainstream in the early 2000s; their album Come Clean was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA[68] and the album's songs ""Blurry"" and ""She Hates Me"" both reached very high positions on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Blurry"" peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and ""She Hates Me"" peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.[69] ""She Hates Me"" also peaked at number 7 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart.[69] The band Default became popular with their song ""Wasting My Time"". It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.[70]

The post-grunge band Cold's song ""Stupid Girl"" peaked at number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100.[71]Post-grunge band Crossfade's song ""Cold"" peaked at number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 23 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart, number 39 on the Pop 100 chart, number 28 on the Pop 100 Airplay chart, and number 57 on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[72] It was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2006.[73] Crossfade's self-titled album was certified platinum by the RIAA in August 2005.[74] Three Days Grace broke into the mainstream during the 2000s; their song ""Just Like You"" peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Mainstream Rock chart and the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[75]

The Three Days Grace song ""I Hate Everything About You"" peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 28 on the Pop Songs chart.[75] In 2006, Three Days Grace released their album One-X, which was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA.[76] The album's song ""Pain"" peaked at number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 47 on the Pop 100 chart and number 35 on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[75]One-X's song ""Never Too Late"" peaked at: number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 12 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart, number 19 on the Pop 100 chart, number 17 on the Pop 100 Airplay chart, number 30 on the Hot Digital Songs chart, number 18 on the Hot Canadian Digital Singles chart, number 13 on the Adult Top 40 chart and number 1 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Recurrents chart.[75]Daughtry broke into the mainstream in 2006 with the release of their self-titled debut album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the post-grunge sound of the album.[77] It sold at least 5,040,000 copies in the United States.[78] The band Flyleaf's song ""All Around Me"" peaked at: number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 12 on the Top 40 Mainstream, number 17 on the Pop 100, number 15 on the Pop 100 Airplay, number 38 on the Hot Digital Songs and number 23 on the Adult Top 40.[79] Flyleaf's self-titled album was certified platinum by the RIAA.[80]"
"Indie rock","

Indie rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Although the term was originally used to describe rock music released through independent record labels, by the 1990s it became more widely associated with the music such bands produced.

The sound of indie rock has its origins in the New Zealand Dunedin sound of the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Tall Dwarfs,[1]the Clean[2] and the Verlaines, and early 1980s college rock radio stations who would frequently play jangle pop bands like the Smiths and R.E.M.. The genre solidified itself during the mid–1980s with NME's C86 cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest in the United States. During the decade, indie rock bands like Sonic Youth, the Pixies and Radiohead all released albums on major labels and subgenres like slowcore, Midwest emo, slacker rock and space rock began. By this time, ""indie"" had evolved to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes on the genre: baggy in Manchester; grebo in Stourbridge and Leicester; and shoegaze in London and the Thames Valley.

During the 1990s, the mainstream success of grunge and Britpop, two movements influenced by indie rock, brought increased attention to the genre and saw record labels use their independent status as a marketing tactic. This led to a split within indie rock: one side conforming to mainstream radio; the other becoming increasingly experimental. By this point, ""indie rock"" referred to the musical style rather than ties to the independent music scene. In the 2000s, indie rock reentered the mainstream through the garage rock and post-punk revival and the influence of the Strokes and the Libertines. This success was exacerbated in the middle of the decade by Bloc Party, the Arctic Monkeys and the Killers and indie rock proliferated into the landfill indie movement.

The term indie rock, which comes from ""independent"", describes the small and relatively low-budget labels on which it is released and the do-it-yourself attitude of the bands and artists involved. Although distribution deals are often struck with major corporate companies, these labels and the bands they host have attempted to retain their autonomy, leaving them free to explore sounds, emotions and subjects of limited appeal to large, mainstream audiences.[3] The influences and styles of the artists have been extremely diverse, including punk, psychedelia, post-punk and country.[4]

The lo-fi, experimental and art rock sound of the Velvet Underground[5] as well as late '70s punk and post-punk bands such as the Fall,[6]Buzzcocks, Wire,Television and Joy Division[7][8] would be influential to the genre.[9]

Allmusic identifies indie rock as including a number of ""varying musical approaches [not] compatible with mainstream tastes"".[10] Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco.[11] In his book DIY Style: Fashion, Music and Global Digital Cultures, Brent Luvaas described the genre as rooted in nostalgia, citing the influence of garage rock and psychedelic rock of the 1960s in progenitors the Stone Roses and the Smiths, in addition to a lyrical preoccupation with literature.[12]

In this same vein, Matthew Bannister defined indie rock as ""small groups of white men playing guitars, influenced by punks and 1960s white pop/rock, within a broader discourse and practice of (degrees of) independence from mainstream musical values.""[13] According to anthropologist Wendy Fonarow, a key element of indie is the dichotomy between a ""puritan ethos"" and a ""romantic one"", with the former using austere ethics, and the latter being eccentric. This is best seen in the contrast between the indie music of United States and the United Kingdom in the 1990s, with British acts being flamboyant performers, while American acts used their lack of virtuosity as a mark of authenticity.[14]

Indie rock is noted for having a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of the feminist-informed riot grrrl music of acts like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, 7 Year Bitch, Team Dresch and Huggy Bear.[15] However, Cortney Harding pointed out that this sense of equality is not reflected in the number of women running indie labels.[16]

The BBC documentary Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie pinpoints the coining of the term ""indie"" to the 1977 self-publication of the Spiral Scratch EP by Manchester punk rock band the Buzzcocks, on their Independent record label New Hormones.[17][18] This inspired a DIY punk movement where bands like Swell Maps, 'O' Level, Television Personalities and Desperate Bicycles followed suit in pressing and distributing their own records.[19][20] Distribution was further improved with the establishment of 'The Cartel', an association of companies like Red Rhino and Rough Trade Records who would take the releases from these small labels and get them into record shops nationwide.[21]

Independent record labels would also be integral to the early years of punk rock musical distribution, as seen with Beserkley Records in the US, who put out The Modern Lovers debut album, and Stiff Records who released the first UK punk single ""New Rose"" by the Damned In Australia,  the Saints had their first punk release outside the US, ""(I'm) Stranded,"" on their own ""Fatal Records"" label. This was  followed by the Go-Betweens releasing 'Lee Remick' a few months later.[22]

Dunedin produced the independent record label Flying Nun Records, whose artists defined the Dunedin sound, which would be particularly influential on the development of indie rock's sound.[23][24][25] According to Audioculture, one of the earliest Dunedin Sound band was Chris Knox's band the Enemy, which emerged as a post-punk group, whose members also included Alec Bathgate. Although the group was only around for a short time, their shows impressed the teenage musicians that came to see them, including a young Shayne Carter, who went on to form Bored Games, the DoubleHappys and Straitjacket Fits. Knox later formed another short-lived punk band called Toy Love, and after it broke up, he went on to start the influential band Tall Dwarfs, who were an integral influence on the emergence of home-recorded lo-fi indie.[26] The punk-inspired aspects of the scene were often inspired by opposition to Robert Muldoon and his government, which prompted satire or outright criticism.[27] The scene saw bands take influence from punk rock, but strip away its aggression for a reverb heavy, pop–influenced sound. Marked by the Clean's 1981 debut single ""Tally-Ho!"" and 1982's Dunedin Double EP featuring the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, the Verlaines and the Stones, its guitars were often jangly and droning and vocals indistinct.[28] The following years, the Dunedin sound spread to other New Zealand cities such as Christchurch or Auckland.[29][25][30][24]

The decade then saw the growing popularity of college radio stations, primarily in the United States, who would play independent artists of various genres, including alternative rock, new wave, post-hardcore and post-punk. The bands broadcast on these station became dubbed ""college rock"" by fans, another term which lacked any stylistic implication. The most prominent college rock bands were jangle pop groups R.E.M., from the US, and the Smiths, from the UK, who Matthew Bannister states were the earliest indie rock groups.[31] These bands' influence was showcased quickly seen in the formation of Let's Active, the Housemartins and the La's.[32] By this time, the term ""indie rock"" had begun to be used to describe the bands who produced music on independent record labels, rather than simply the record labels themselves. This made it the only genre at the time which was defined by the methods by which the music was distributed rather than the sound of said music.[4]

Journalist Steve Taylor also cited the bands involved in the Paisley Underground scene as early indie groups.[33]  However, this jangly style became increasingly mainstream as the decade progressed leading subsequent indie rock bands to abandon this style. Instead, in the following years the Jesus and Mary Chain and Flying Nun Records bands like the Jean-Paul Sartre Experience morphed the genre into a slower, darker and more hypnotic style.[31] The number of college radio stations in the US decreased significantly following NPR's lobbying against noncommercial station during the 1980s. In turn, the name ""college rock"" fell into disfavour, soon being replaced by ""indie"".[34]

In the United Kingdom, NME released the C86 compilation cassette, which consisted of tracks by groups including Primal Scream, the Pastels and the Wedding Present. Intended to showcase the UK's current independent music scene, the album was made up of groups combining elements of jangle pop, post-punk and Phil Spector indebted Walls of Sound. In 2006, Bob Stanley called it ""the beginning of indie music"".[35] C86 became a descriptor in its own right, describing not only the bands on the tape but also bands who it influenced, often used alongside terms like ""anorak pop"" and ""shambling"".[36] Some C86 bands found significant commercial success: the Soup Dragons went on to sell out Madison Square Garden; Primal Scream were critically acclaimed, receiving the first ever Mercury Prize in 1992; the Wedding Present charted eighteen times in the Top 40; however many bands in its twenty-two track runtime also fell into obscurity.[37]

In the United States, the popularity of R.E.M. allowed those disliking of hardcore punk's aggression to become a part of the underground music scene. This empowered an array of musicians, particularly those in what would become the post-hardcore scene as led by the Minutemen.[38] Furthermore, major labels began to pursue underground bands, with both Hüsker Dü and the Replacements releasing albums on majors in the middle of the decade. While these albums did not see the same success as R.E.M., and major labels soon lost interest in the scene, they did have a large impact on younger bands. In the following years, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest began to release music on independent labels indebted to these bands, and soon too picked up the categorisation of indie rock.[39] As the 1980s closed, both Sonic Youth and the Pixies signed to major labels.[40]

In the late 1980s, the indie rock subgenre shoegaze emerged, as a continuation of the wall of sound production being used by groups like the Jesus and Mary Chain. The genre merged this with influences from Dinosaur Jr. and the Cocteau Twins, to create a dark and droning style so cacophonous that instruments were often indistinguishable. The genre was pioneered by My Bloody Valentine on their early EPs and debut album Isn't Anything.[41] The band's style influenced a wave of bands in London and the Thames Valley area including Chapterhouse, Moose and Lush. This scene was collectively termed ""the Scene That Celebrates Itself"" by Melody Maker's Steve Sutherland in 1990.[42]

Madchester was another style and scene that originated in the late 1980s. Defined by its merger of  C86 indie rock, dance music and Hedonist rave culture, particularly its emphasis on the use of psychedelic drugs, the scene was centred in Manchester.[43][44] The scene was based around the Haçienda nightclub, which opened in May 1982 as an initiative of Factory Records. For the first few years of its life, the club played predominantly club-oriented pop music and hosted performances by artists including New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Culture Club, Thompson Twins and the Smiths.[45] The Madchester movement burgeoned by 1989, with the success of the Happy Mondays second album Bummed and the Stone Roses' self-titled debut, which became the most influential work in the scene. In the following years, addition high profile acts included the Charlatans, 808 State and the Inspiral Carpets.[46]

The Madchester scene's distinct combination of indie rock and dance music became termed indie dance by critics, or more specifically the subgenre baggy.[47] Madchester and baggy's most infamous moment was the 27 May 1990 Spike Island concert headlined by the Stone Roses. With an attendance of around 28,000 and lasting twelve hours, it was the first event of its size and kind to be hosted by an independent act.[48]

In Stourbridge, a scene of indie bands who took influence from electronic, punk, folk and hip-hop music emerged, dubbed grebo by critics. Fronted by Pop Will Eat Itself, the Wonder Stuff and Ned's Atomic Dustbin, ""grebo"" was broadly defined, and was used more as a name for the Stourbridge scene than as a genre label. However, the bands quickly gained attention: Pop Will Eat Itself's 1989 singles ""Wise Up! Sucker"" and ""Can U Dig It?"" both entered the UK Top 40 and Stourbridge briefly became a tourist attraction for young indie rock fans.

The seminal albums from the scene were released between 1989 and 1993: the Wonder Stuff's Hup and Never Loved Elvis; Ned's Atomic Dustbin's God Fodder and Are You Normal?; and Pop Will Eat Itself's This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This! and The Looks or the Lifestyle?. In this period, the scene's bands became fixtures, sometimes headliners, at Reading Festival, sold millions of albums and were frequently featured on the covers of magazines like NME and Melody Maker.[49]

Grebo bands were distinct from prior indie rock groups not only because of their broad influences, but their subversion of the twee or unhappy moods of most other bands in the genre, and their pursuit of a heavier sound and aesthetic. The scene  came to include the stylistically similar bands of nearby Leicester: the Bomb Party, Gaye Bykers on Acid, Crazyhead, the Hunters Club and Scum Pups.[50]

In the early 1990s, the Seattle grunge scene, and its most visible acts, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, broke into the mainstream.[52] The monumental success of these bands, particularly Nirvana, brought increased attention to the indie rock scene, which initiated a shift in which the indie rock descriptor became displaced by the term alternative rock.[51] As a result, the term ""alternative"" lost its original counter-cultural meaning and began to refer to the new, commercially lighter form of music that was now achieving mainstream success. New York magazine writer Carl Swanson argued that even the term ""sellout""  lost its meaning as grunge made it possible for a niche movement, no matter how radical, to be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture.[53]

In his book Popular Music: The Key Concepts, media academic Roy Shuker states that ""Grunge represented the mainstreaming of the North American indie rock ethic and style of the 1980s"", going on to explain that a band's status as independent became ""As much a marketing device as [indie rock and alternative rock were an] identifiable 'sound'"".[54] In the wake of this increased attention, indie rock experienced a split: accessible bands who catered to the now-popular alternative rock radio; and bands who continued to experiment, advancing in the underground.[32] According to AllMusic, it was during this split that ""indie rock"" solidified itself as a term for the style of music played by these underground artists, while the mainstream indie rock-influenced bands became termed alternative rock.[3]

Slowcore developed in the United States as a direct counterpoint to the rapid growth of grunge.[55] Although loosely defined, slowcore generally includes slow tempos, minimalist instrumentals and sad lyrics.[56]Galaxie 500, particularly their second album On Fire (1989), were heavy influences on the genre,[57][58] with Bandcamp Daily writer Robert Rubsam, calling them the ""fountainhead for all that would come"".[59] The first wave of bands in the genre included Red House Painters, Codeine, Bedhead, Ida and Low. The genre originated from around the United States, with no geographic focus, and very little interaction between its artists.[59]

A younger subset of grebo bands emerged around 1991, who were in turn labelled ""fraggle"" bands.[60] During this movement, the dominant sound was a style of indie rock that was heavily indebted to punk and Nirvana's album Bleach album, while also occasionally making use of drum machines.[61]Gigwise writer Steven Kline described the style as ""filthy guitars, filthier hair and t-shirts only a mother would wash"". Prominent fraggle acts included Senseless Things, Mega City Four and Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine.[61]

Spin writer Charles Aaron described Pavement and Guided by Voices as ""the two bands that came to exemplify indie rock in this period, and still define the term in many people's minds"". Both bands made use of a Lo-fi production style which romanticised their D.I.Y. ethos.[62] Pavement's 1992 album Slanted and Enchanted, was one of the defining albums of the slacker rock subgenre.[63]Rolling Stone called the album ""the quintessential indie rock album"", placing it on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[64]

In the North Carolina Research Triangle, an indie rock scene was being spearheaded by groups enfranched Merge Records like Superchunk, Archers of Loaf and Polvo.
describing a growing scene of indie-rock bands who were influenced by hardcore punk and post-punk.[65] At the time, publications such as Entertainment Weekly took to calling the college town of Chapel Hill the ""next Seattle"".[66][67] Superchunk's single ""Slack Motherfucker"" has also been credited by Columbia magazine with popularizing the ""slacker"" stereotype, and as a defining anthem of 90s indie rock.[68]

With the rise of Britpop, many of Britain's earlier indie rock bands fell into obscurity.[69] Fronted by Blur, Oasis, Pulp and Suede,[70] the bands in the movement were advertised as being underground artists, as a means to compete commercially with the United States' grunge scene.[71] While Britpop was stylistically indebted to indie rock and began as an offshoot of it, Britpop bands abandoned the genre's earlier anti-establishment politics and instead brought it into the mainstream, with bands like Blur and Pulp even signing to major labels.

In her essay Labouring the Point? The Politics of Britain in ""New Britain"", politician and academic Rupa Huq states that Britpop ""began as an offshoot of the independent British music scene but arguably ended up killing it, as a convergence took place between indie and mainstream, removing the distinctive 'protest' element of British-based independent music""[13] Music journalist John Harris has suggested that Britpop began when Blur's fourth single ""Popscene"" and Suede's debut ""The Drowners"" were released around the same time in the spring of 1992. He stated, ""[I]f Britpop started anywhere, it was the deluge of acclaim that greeted Suede's first records: all of them audacious, successful and very, very British.""[72] Suede were the first of the new crop of guitar-orientated bands to be embraced by the UK music media as Britain's answer to Seattle's grunge sound. Their debut album Suede for the fastest-selling debut album in the UK.[73]

Sunny Day Real Estate's debut album, Diary (1994), began a new wave of the emo genre, by incorporating elements of it into their indie rock sound.[74] Sunny Day Real Estate and other second wave emo bands, including Piebald, the Promise Ring and Cap'n Jazz distanced emo from its hardcore roots and allowed the genre to develop a much more realised scene than its first wave.[75]

This style of emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s, with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most (2001).[76] One particularly notable scene during this wave was the Midwest emo bands of the latter half of the decade, who incorporated the jangly guitar tones of earlier indie rock and elements of math rock to create the distinctive style of groups like American Football.[75] The popularity of emo, also allowed a number of ""not-quite-indie-not-quite-emo"" bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Modest Mouse and Karate to gain significant attention.[77]

The loosely defined Elephant 6 collective – which included the Apples in Stereo, Beulah, Circulatory System, Elf Power, the Minders, Neutral Milk Hotel, of Montreal and the Olivia Tremor Control – merged indie rock with psychedelic pop. Gimme Indie Rock author Andrew Earles stated that the collective, namely Neutral Milk Hotel on On Avery Island (1996), ""helped keep the genre artistically relevant while other bands defected and other underground styles rose to prominence"".[78][79]

Indie electronic or indietronica[80] covers rock-based artists who share an affinity for electronic music, using samplers, synthesizers, drum machines, and computer programs.[81] Less a style and more a categorization, it describes an early 1990s trend of acts who followed in the traditions of early electronic music (composers of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), krautrock and synth-pop.[81] Progenitors of the genre were English bands Disco Inferno, Stereolab, and Space.[81] Most musicians in the genre can be found on independent labels like Warp, Morr Music, Sub Pop or Ghostly International.[81]

Space rock took the psychedelic rock, ambient music influence of Pink Floyd and Hawkwind and incorporated them into an indie rock context. The style began with Spacemen 3 in the 1980s, with later groups including Spiritualized, Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Quickspace.[82]

As Britpop waned towards the end of the decade, post-Britpop took hold within the UK's indie rock scene.[83]
From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.[84][85] After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention.[84]The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead –  although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 –  achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).[86]Stereophonics, used elements of a post-grunge and hardcore on their breakthrough albums Word Gets Around (1997) and Performance and Cocktails (1999), before moving into more melodic territory with Just Enough Education to Perform (2001) and subsequent albums.[87][88]

Feeder, who were initially more influenced by American post-grunge, producing a hard rock sound that led to their breakthrough single ""Buck Rogers"" and the album Echo Park (2001).[89] After the death of their drummer Jon Lee, they moved to a more reflective and introspective mode on Comfort in Sound (2002), their most commercially successful album to that point, which spawned a series of hit singles.[90]

The most commercially successful band in the millennium were Coldplay, whose first two albums Parachutes (2000) and A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) went multi-platinum, establishing them as one of the most popular acts in the world by the time of their third album X&Y (2005).[91][92] Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" (from their 2006 album Eyes Open) is the most widely played song of the 21st century on UK radio.[93]

The mainstream attention which indie rock garnered in the 2000s began with the Strokes and their 2001 debut album Is This It. Playing a style indebted to '60s-70s bands like the Velvet Underground and the Ramones, the band's intention musically was to sound like ""a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record.""[94] The album peaked at number thirty-three in the United States, staying in the charts for two additional years and debuted at number two on the UK albums chart.[94][95] When the Strokes made their commercial debut, the public perception of ""rock music"" was based in post-grunge, nu metal and rap rock, putting their throwback style of garage rock as a stark contrast to the mainstream. The band's immediate influence allowed fellow classic rock influenced New York bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol and TV on the Radio to gain mainstream attention.[96] The Strokes were accompanied in this commercial breakthrough by the White Stripes, the Vines, and the Hives. These groups were christened by parts of the media as the ""The"" bands, and dubbed ""the saviours of rock 'n' roll"",[97] prompting Rolling Stone magazine to declare on its September 2002 cover, ""Rock is Back!""[98]

The success of the Strokes revitalised the then-dying underground post-Britpop scene in the United Kingdom with groups who took the band's influence and experimented with their sound. This first wave of UK acts included Franz Ferdinand, Kasabian, Maxïmo Park, the Cribs, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs and the Others.[99] However, the Libertines, who formed in 1997, stood as the UK's counterpoint to the Strokes, being described by AllMusic as ""one of the U.K.'s most influential 21st century acts""[100] and the Independent stating that ""the Libertines wanted to be an important band, but they could not have predicted the impact they would have"".[101] Influenced by the Clash, the Kinks, the Smiths and the Jam,[100] the band's style of tinny, high register, sometimes acoustic, guitar parts topped by lyrics of British parochial pleasures in the vocalists' authentic English accents became widely imitated.[101]The Fratellis, the Kooks, and the View were three such acts to gain significant commercial success, although the most prominent post-Libertines band was Sheffield's Arctic Monkeys.[101] One of the earliest groups to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking,[102] the Arctic Monkeys had two No. 1 singles, and their album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006) became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.[103]

In this success, legacy indie bands soon entered the mainstream,[104] including Modest Mouse (whose 2004 album Good News for People Who Love Bad News reached the US top 40 and was nominated for a Grammy Award), Bright Eyes (who in 2004 had two singles at the top of the Billboard magazine Hot 100 Single Sales)[105] and Death Cab for Cutie (whose 2005 album Plans debuted at number four in the US, remaining on the Billboard charts for nearly one year and achieving platinum status and a Grammy nomination).[106] This new commercial breakthrough and the widespread use of the term indie to other forms of popular culture, led a number of commentators to suggest that indie rock had ceased to be a meaningful term.[107][108]

Additionally, a second wave of bands emerged in the United States that managed to gain international recognition as a result of the movement included the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, the Shins, the Bravery, Spoon, the Hold Steady, and the National.[76] The most commercially successful band of this wave was Las Vegas' the Killers. Formed in 2001, after hearing Is This It, the band scrapped the majority of their prior material to rewrite it under the Strokes' influence.[109] The band's debut single ""Mr. Brightside"" spent 260 non-consecutive weeks, or five years, on the UK Singles Chart as of April 2021, the most out of any song,[110][111] and As of 2017[update], it had charted on the UK Singles Chart in 11 of the last 13 years,[112] including a 35-week run peaking at number 49 in 2016–2017.[113] Furthermore, it was the UK's most streamed pre-2010 song, until it was surpassed in late 2018,[114] and continued to be purchased for download hundreds of times a week by 2017.[115] In March 2018, the song reached the milestone of staying in the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart for 200 weeks.[115]

The impact of the Strokes, the Libertines and Bloc Party led to significant major label interest in indie rock artists, which was then exacerbated by the success of the Arctic Monkeys. In the years following Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not there was a proliferation of bands such as the Rifles, the Pigeon Detectives and Milburn, who created a more formulaic derivative of the earlier acts.[116][99] By the end of the decade, critics had taken to referring to this wave of acts as ""landfill indie"",[117][118][119] a description coined by Andrew Harrison of the Word magazine.[120] A 2020 Vice article cited Johnny Borrell, vocalist of Razorlight, as the ""one man who defined, embodied and lived Landfill Indie"" due his forming of a ""spectacularly middle-of-the-road"" band despite his close proximity to the Libertines' ""desperate kinetic energy, mythologised love-hate dynamic and vision of a dilapidated Britain animated by romance and narcotics"".[116] In a 2009 article for the Guardian, journalist Peter Robinson cited the landfill indie movement as dead, blaming the Wombats, Scouting For Girls, and Joe Lean & the Jing Jang Jong by stating ""If landfill indie had been a game of Buckaroo, those three sent the whole donkey's arse of radio-friendly mainstream guitar band monotony flying high into the air, legs flailing.""[121]

There continued to be commercial successes in the 2010s Arcade Fire's The Suburbs (2010), the Black Keys's Turn Blue (2014), Kings of Leon's Walls (2016), the Killers's Wonderful Wonderful (2017), which reached number one on the Billboard charts in the United States and the official chart in the United Kingdom, with Arcade Fire's album winning a Grammy for Album of The Year in 2011.[122] Other indie rock acts like Florence and the Machine, the Decemberists and LCD Soundsystem gained number one singles in the United States during the decade, with Vampire Weekend, Florence and the Machine, Arctic Monkeys, Bon Iver, the Killers and the Postal Service gaining platinum selling records.[123] Vampire Weekend's third studio album Modern Vampires of the City (2013) received the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2014, with Consequence writer Tyler Clark stating that in 2019 it was still ""an indie rock standard bearer in the wider world of music"".[123] Arctic Monkeys' fifth album AM (2013) was one of the biggest indie rock albums of the decade, charting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, having sold 157,329 copies, thus becoming the second fastest-selling album of the year.[124] With the debut of AM on the chart, Arctic Monkeys also broke a record, becoming the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums.[125] As of June 2019, AM has spent 300 weeks in the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart.[126] The album also peaked at number one in Australia, Belgium (Flanders), Croatia, Slovenia, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal, and reached top ten positions in several other countries. In the United States, the album sold 42,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's highest-charting album in the United States.[127] In August 2017, AM was certified platinum by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units over of a million units in the United States.[128] As of the 14th of April 2023 every track from the album was certified silver or higher by the BPI with ""Mad Sounds"" being the last to be certified.[129]

When the 1975's merger of indie rock and mainstream pop began gaining commercial attraction in the early 2010s, it was controversial; they received the award for ""Worst Band"" at the 2014 NME Awards, but by 2017 received ""Best Live Band"" at the same award show.[130]Alternative Press writer Yasmine Summan stated that ""If you could summarize 2013 and 2014 in one album for indie and alternative fans, it would be the 1975's self-titled release"".[131] In an article for the Guardian accrediting the 1975 as the band to ""usher indie into the mainstream"", writer Mark Beaumont compared vocalist Matty Healy's influence on the genre to that of Libertines vocalist Pete Doherty,[132] and Pitchfork listed them as one of the most influential artists in music since 1995.[133] In the 1975's wake, a number of other indie pop artist gained popularity. Some critics termed this phenomenon ""Healywave"", which notably included: Pale Waves, the Aces, Joan, Fickle Friends and No Rome.[134] Of this group, Pale Waves were particularly commercially prominent, with their debut album My Mind Makes Noises peaking at number eight on the UK albums chart, Who Am I? (2021) at number three and Unwanted (2022) at number four.[135] At around the same time Wolf Alice became a prominent force in the scene, with their second album Visions of a Life (2017) winning the Mercury Prize in 2018 and third album Blue Weekend (2021) being nominated.[136] Writer Martin Young stated in a 2021 article for Dork that ""It's impossible to truly state just how important Wolf Alice are. They are the catalyst for almost all the amazing bands you've read about in Dork over the last 5 years.""[137]"
"Classic rock","

Classic rock is a radio format that developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s.[2] In the United States, it comprises rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s,[3][a] primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format.[2] The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s.[5]

Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners, music associated with this format received more exposure with younger listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading.[6] Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station's sound, or by heritage acts which are still active and producing new music.[7]

Among academics and historians, classic rock has been discussed as an effort by critics, media, and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy. The music selected for the format has been identified as predominantly commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere, expressing values of Romanticism, self-aggrandizement, and politically undemanding ideologies. It has been associated with the album era (1960s–2000s), particularly the period's early pop/rock music.

The classic rock format evolved from AOR radio stations that were attempting to appeal to an older audience by including familiar songs of the past with current hits.[8] In 1980, AOR radio station M105 in Cleveland began billing itself as ""Cleveland's Classic Rock"", playing a mix of rock music from the mid-1960s to the present.[9] Similarly, WMET called itself ""Chicago's Classic Rock"" in 1981.[10] In 1982, radio consultant Lee Abrams developed the ""Timeless Rock"" format, which combined contemporary AOR with rock hits from the 1960s and 1970s.[11]

KRBE, an AM station in Houston, was an early classic rock radio station. In 1983, program director Paul Christy designed a format which played only early album rock, from the 1960s and early 1970s, without current music or any titles from the pop or dance side of Top 40.[12] Another AM station airing classic rock, beginning in 1983, was KRQX in Dallas-Fort Worth.[13]  KRQX was co-owned with an album rock station, 97.9 KZEW.  Management saw the benefit in the FM station appealing to younger rock fans and the AM station appealing a bit older.  The ratings of both stations could be added together to appeal to advertisers. Classic rock soon became the widely used descriptor for the format and became the commonly used term among the general public for early album rock music.

In the mid-1980s, the format's widespread proliferation came on the heels of Jacobs Media's (Fred Jacobs) success at WCXR, in Washington, D.C., and Edinborough Rand's (Gary Guthrie) success at WZLX in Boston. Between Guthrie and Jacobs, they converted more than 40 major market radio stations to their individual brand of classic rock over the next several years.[14]

Billboard magazine's Kim Freeman posits that ""while classic rock's origins can be traced back earlier, 1986 is generally cited as the year of its birth"".[15]  By 1986, the success of the format resulted in oldies accounting for 60–80% of the music played on album rock stations.[16] Although it began as a niche format spun off from AOR, by 2001, classic rock had surpassed album rock in market share nationally.[17]

During the mid-1980s, the classic rock format was mainly tailored to the adult male demographic ages 25–34, which remained its largest demographic through the mid-1990s.[18] As the format's audience aged, its demographics skewed toward older age groups. By 2006, the 35–44 age group was the format's largest audience;[19] by 2014, the 45–54 year-old demographic was the largest.[20]

Typically, classic rock stations play rock songs from the mid-1960s through the 1980s and began adding 1990s music in the early 2010s. Most recently, there has been a ""newer classic rock"" under the slogan of the next generation of classic rock.  Stations such as WLLZ in Detroit, WBOS in Boston, and WKQQ in Lexington play music focusing more on harder edge classic rock from the 1980s to the 2000s.[21][22][23]

Some of the artists that are featured heavily on classic rock radio are the Beatles,[24]Pink Floyd, Genesis, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Quiet Riot, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Def Leppard, Boston, the Cars, Fleetwood Mac, Billy Joel, Elton John, Bryan Adams, Eric Clapton, the Who, Van Halen, Rush, Black Sabbath, U2, Guns N' Roses, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eagles, the Doors, Kiss, Styx,[25]Queen, Led Zeppelin,[26] and Jimi Hendrix.[26] The songs of the Rolling Stones, particularly from the 1970s, have become staples of classic rock radio.[27] ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" (1965),[28] ""Under My Thumb"" (1966),[29] ""Paint It Black"" (1966),[30] and ""Miss You"" (1978) are among their most popular selections, with Complex calling the latter ""an eternal mainstay on classic-rock radio"".[31]

A 2006 Rolling Stone article noted that teens were surprisingly interested in classic rock and speculated that the interest in the older bands might be related to the absence of any new, dominant sounds in rock music since the advent of grunge.[26]

Ideologically, 'classic rock' serves to confirm the dominant status of a particular period of music history – the emergence of rock in the mid-1960s – with its associated values and set of practices: live performance, self-expression, and authenticity; the group as the creative unit, with the charismatic lead singer playing a key role, and the guitar as the primary instrument. This was a version of classic Romanticism, an ideology with its origins in art and aesthetics.

— Roy Shuker (2016)[32]

Classic-rock radio programmers largely play ""tried and proven"" hit songs from the past based on their ""high listener recognition and identification"", says media academic Roy Shuker, who also identifies white male rock acts from Sgt. Pepper-era Beatles through the late 1970s as the focus of their playlists.[32] As Catherine Strong observes, classic rock songs are generally performed by white male acts from either the United States or the United Kingdom, ""have a four-four time, very rarely exceed the time limit of four minutes, were composed by the musicians themselves, are sung in English, played by a 'classical' rock formation (drums, bass, guitar, keyboard instruments) and were released on a major label after 1964.""[33] Classic rock has also been associated with the album era (1960s–2000s), by writers Bob Lefsetz[34] and Matthew Restall, who says the term is a relabeling of the ""virtuoso pop/rock"" from the era's early decades.[35]

The format's origins are traced by music scholar Jon Stratton to the emergence of a classic-rock canon.[36] This canon arose in part from music journalism and superlative lists ranking certain albums and songs that are consequently reinforced to the collective and public memory.[33]Robert Christgau says the classic-rock concept transmogrified rock music into a ""myth of rock as art-that-stands-the-test-of-time"". He also believes it was inevitable that certain rock artists would be canonized by critics, major media, and music establishment entities such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[37] In 2018, Steven Hyden recalls how the appearance of classic rock as a timeless music lent it a distinction from the ""inherently nihilistic"" pop he had first listened to on the radio as a teenager in the early 1990s. ""[I]t seemed to have been around forever,"" he writes of the classic rock format. ""It was there long before I was born, and I was sure it was still going to be around after I was gone.""[38]

Politically, the mindset underlying classic rock is regarded by Christgau as regressive. He says the music in this format abandoned ironic sensibilities in favor of unintellectual, conventional aesthetics rooted in Victorian era Romanticism, while downplaying the more radical aspects of 1960s counterculture, such as politics, race, African-American music, and pop in the art sense. ""Though classic rock draws its inspiration and most of its heroes from the '60s, it is, of course, a construction of the '70s,"" he writes in 1991 for Details magazine. ""It was invented by prepunk/predisco radio programmers who knew that before they could totally commodify '60s culture they'd have to rework it—that is, selectively distort it till it threatened no one ... In the official rock pantheon the Doors and Led Zeppelin are Great Artists while Chuck Berry and Little Richard are Primitive Forefathers and James Brown and Sly Stone are Something Else.""[37]

Regarding the relationship of economics to the rise of classic rock, Christgau believes there was compromised socioeconomic security and diminishing collective consciousness of a new generation of listeners in the 1970s, who succeeded rock's early years during baby-boomer economic prosperity in the United States: ""Not for nothing did classic rock crown the Doors' mystagogic middlebrow escapism and Led Zep's chest-thumping megalomaniac grandeur. Rhetorical self-aggrandizement that made no demands on everyday life was exactly what the times called for.""[37] Shuker attributes the rise of classic-rock radio in part to ""the consumer power of the aging post-war 'baby boomers' and the appeal of this group to radio advertisers"". In his opinion, classic rock also produced a rock music ideology and discussion of the music that was ""heavily gendered"", celebrating ""a male homosocial paradigm of musicianship"" that ""continued to dominate subsequent discourse, not just around rock music, but of popular music more generally.""[32]"
"Emo","Emo /ˈiːmoʊ/ is a music genre characterized by emotional, often confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style of hardcore punk and post-hardcore from the mid-1980s Washington, D.C. hardcore scene, where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore. The bands Rites of Spring and Embrace, among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock, punk rock, and pop-punk bands, including Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, Cap'n Jazz, and Jimmy Eat World. By the mid-1990s, Braid, the Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged from Midwest emo, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, screamo, a more aggressive style of emo using screamed vocals, also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Story of the Year, Thursday, the Used, and Underoath.
Often seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes skinny jeans, black eyeliner, tight t-shirts with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as emo kids or emos. The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with social alienation, sensitivity, misanthropy, introversion, and angst. Purported links to depression, self-harm, and suicide, combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a backlash against emo, with some bands, including My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco, rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.
Emo and its subgenre emo pop entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, and many artists signed contracts with major record labels. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy, and The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some emo bands changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, with bands such as the World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Modern Baseball, some drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called emo rap became mainstream; its most famous artists included Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Juice Wrld."
"Experimental rock","Experimental rock, also called avant-rock, is a subgenre of rock music[2] that pushes the boundaries of common composition and performance technique[11] or which experiments with the basic elements of the genre.[12] Artists aim to liberate and innovate, with some of the genre's distinguishing characteristics being improvisational performances, avant-garde influences, odd instrumentation, opaque lyrics (or instrumentals), unorthodox structures and rhythms, and an underlying rejection of commercial aspirations.[3]

From its inception, rock music was experimental, but it was not until the late 1960s that rock artists began creating extended and complex compositions through advancements in multitrack recording. In 1967, the genre was as commercially viable as pop music, but by 1970, most of its leading players had incapacitated themselves in some form.[clarification needed] In Germany, the krautrock subgenre merged elements of improvisation and psychedelic rock with electronic music, avant-garde and contemporary classical pieces. Later in the 1970s,  significant musical crossbreeding took place in tandem with the developments of punk and new wave, DIY experimentation, and electronic music. Funk, jazz-rock, and fusion rhythms also became integrated into experimental rock music.

Early 1980s experimental rock groups had few direct precedents for their sound. Later in the decade, avant-rock pursued a psychedelic aesthetic that differed from the self-consciousness and vigilance of earlier post-punk. During the 1990s, a loose movement known as post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock. As of the 2010s, the term ""experimental rock"" has fallen to indiscriminate use, with many modern rock bands being categorized under prefixes such as ""post-"", ""kraut-"", ""psych-"", ""art-"", ""prog-"", ""avant-"" and ""noise-"".

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as Lou Reed put it, there were those were trying to become much better musicians, or much better players of their instruments at any rate, and those who were trying to forget what little they already knew. The presumption in the latter case was that technical skill was getting in the way of, or replacing, significance.

—Bill Martin writing in his book Avant Rock (2002)[13]

Although experimentation had always existed in rock music,[nb 1] it was not until the late 1960s that new openings were created from the aesthetic intersecting with the social.[15][jargon] In 1966, the boundaries between pop music and the avant-garde began to blur as rock albums were conceived and executed as distinct, extended statements.[16] Self-taught rock musicians in the middle and late 1960s drew from the work of composers such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Luciano Berio. Academic Bill Martin writes: ""in the case of imitative painters, what came out was almost always merely derivative, whereas in the case of rock music, the result could be quite original, because assimilation, synthesis, and imitation are integral parts of the language of rock.""[17]

Martin says that the advancing technology of multitrack recording and mixing boards were more influential to experimental rock than electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-classically trained musicians to create extended and complex compositions.[18] Drawing from the influence of George Martin, the Beatles' producer, and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, music producers after the mid-1960s began to view the recording studio as an instrument used to aid the process of composition.[19][nb 2] When the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966) was released to a four-month chart stay in the British top 10, many British groups responded to the album by making more experimental use of recording studio techniques.[21][nb 3]

In the late 1960s, groups such as the Mothers of Invention, the Velvet Underground, the Fugs, the Monks, Red Krayola, Soft Machine, Pink Floyd and the Beatles began incorporating elements of avant-garde music, sound collage, and poetry in their work.[24] Historian David Simonelli writes that, further to the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (Revolver, 1966), the band's February 1967 double A-side single, pairing ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" with ""Penny Lane"", ""establish[ed] the Beatles as the most avant-garde [rock] composers of the postwar era"".[25] Aside from the Beatles, author Doyle Greene identifies Frank Zappa, the Velvet Underground, Plastic Ono Band, Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, Pink Floyd, the Soft Machine and Nico as ""pioneers of avant-rock"".[26][nb 4] In addition, The Quietus' Ben Graham described duos the Silver Apples and Suicide as antecedents of avant-rock.[28]Pitchfork cited Red Krayola as being ""likely the most experimental band of the 1960s"".[29]

In the opinion of Stuart Rosenberg, the first ""noteworthy"" experimental rock group was the Mothers of Invention, led by composer Frank Zappa.[2] Greene recognises the group's debut album, Freak Out!, as marking the ""emergence of the 'avant-rock' studio album"" at a time when Warhol's presentation of the Velvet Underground's shows was redefining the parameters of a rock concert.[30] According to author Kelly Fisher Lowe, Zappa ""set the tone"" for experimental rock with the way he incorporated ""countertextural aspects ... calling attention to the very recordedness of the album"".[31] This was reflected in other contemporary experimental rock LPs, such as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and Smile, the Who's The Who Sell Out (1967) and Tommy (1969), and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).[31] The Velvet Underground were a ""groundbreaking group in experimental rock"", according to Rosenberg, ""even further out of step with popular culture than the early recordings of the Mothers of Invention"".[32] The band were playing experimental rock in 1965 before other significant countercultural rock scenes had developed,[33] pioneering avant-rock through their integration of minimalist rock and avant-garde ideas.[34][nb 5]

The Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's inspired a new consideration for experimental rock as commercially viable music.[36] Once the group released their December 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour, author Barry Faulk writes, ""pop music and experimental rock were [briefly] synonymous, and the Beatles stood at the apex of a progressive movement in musical capitalism"".[37] The musical passage recorded by the Doors in 1968, ""Not to Touch the Earth"", is what critic Mick Wall described as ""nearly four minutes of avant-rock.""[38] As progressive rock developed, experimental rock acquired notoriety alongside art rock.[2][nb 6]  By 1970, most of the musicians which had been at the forefront of experimental rock had incapacitated themselves.[40][clarification needed][verification needed] From then on, the ideas and work of British artist and former Roxy Music member Brian Eno—which suggested that ideas from the art world, including those of experimental music and the avant-garde, should be deployed in the context of experimental rock—were a key innovation throughout the decade.[41]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Germany's ""krautrock"" scene (also referred to as kosmische or elektronische musik) saw bands develop a form of experimental rock[6][42] that drew on rock sources, such as the Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, as well as wider avant-garde influences.[24] Groups such as Can, Faust, Neu!, Amon Düül II, Ash Ra Tempel, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, and Popol Vuh merged elements of psychedelic rock with electronic music, funk rhythms, jazz improvisation, and avant-garde and contemporary classical compositions,[43][42] as well as new electronic instrumentation.[24] The ideas of minimalism and composers such as Stockhausen would be particularly influential.[24] The movement was partly born out of the student movements of 1968, as German youth sought a unique countercultural identity[42][24] and wanted to develop a form of German music that was distinct from the mainstream music of the period.[6]

The late 1970s post-punk movement was devised as a break with rock tradition, exploring new possibilities by embracing electronics, noise, jazz and the classical avant-garde, and the production methods of dub and disco.[44] During this era, funk, jazz-rock, and fusion rhythms became integrated into experimental rock music.[45] Some groups who were categorized as ""post-punk"" considered themselves part of an experimental rock trajectory, with This Heat as one of the prominent players.[46] The late 1970s no wave scene consisted of New York experimental rock bands that aimed to break with new wave,[8] and who, according to Village Voice writer Steve Anderson, pursued an abrasive reductionism which ""undermined the power and mystique of a rock vanguard by depriving it of a tradition to react against.""[47] Anderson claims that the no wave scene represented ""New York's last stylistically cohesive avant-rock movement.""[47]

The early 1980s would see avant-rock develop significantly following the punk and new wave, DIY experimentation, electronic music, and musical cross-breeding of the previous decade, according to Pitchfork.[48] Dominique Leone of Pitchfork claims that the first wave of 1980s experimental rock groups, including acts such as Material, the Work, This Heat, Ornette Coleman's Prime Time, James Blood Ulmer, Last Exit, and Massacre, had few direct precedents for their sound.[48] Steve Redhead noted the resuscitation of New York's avant-rock scene, including artists such as Sonic Youth and John Zorn, in the 1980s.[49] According to journalist David Stubbs, ""no other major rock group [...] has done as much to try to bridge the gap between rock and the avant garde"" as Sonic Youth, who drew on improvisation and noise as well as the Velvet Underground.[50]

In the late 1980s, avant-rock pursued a ""frazzled, psychedelia-tinged, 'blissed out'"" aesthetic that differed from the self-consciousness and vigilance of earlier post-punk.[51]  The UK shoegaze scene was seen by some as a continuation of an experimental rock tradition.[52]Pitchfork described contemporary acts My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, and the Jesus and Mary Chain as ""avant-rock icons.""[53] According to Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, some 1980s and early 1990s avant-rock acts such as the British musicians David Sylvian and Talk Talk returned to the ideas of progressive rock, which they call ""post-progressive"".[54] During the 1990s, a loose movement known as post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock.[9] In a reaction against traditional rock music formula, post-rock artists combined standard rock instrumentation with electronics and influences from styles such as ambient music, IDM, krautrock, minimalism, and jazz.[9] In 2015, The Quietus' Bryan Brussee noted uncertainty with the term ""experimental rock"", and that ""it seems like every rock band today has some kind of post-, kraut-, psych-, or noise- prefixed to their genre.""[55]"
"Art rock","

Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from entertainment to an artistic statement,[8] opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music.[3] Influences may be drawn from genres such as experimental music, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.[1]

Art rock's music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing,[3] and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock.[8] The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with ""progressive rock"", though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures.

The genre's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists. The music, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity.[3] Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of punk rock in the mid-1970s.[9]  After, the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.[3]

Critic John Rockwell says that art rock is one of rock's most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment, classical music pretensions, and experimental, avant-garde proclivities.[10]  In the rock music of the 1970s, the ""art"" descriptor was generally understood to mean ""aggressively avant-garde"" or ""pretentiously progressive"".[11] ""Art rock"" is often used synonymously with progressive rock.[12][10][1][3] Historically, the term has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music.[13] The first is progressive rock, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favor of a modernist, avant-garde approach defined by the Velvet Underground.[13] Essayist Ellen Willis compared these two types:

From the early sixties … there was a counter-tradition in rock and roll that had much more in common with high art—in particular avant-garde art—than the ballyhooed art-rock synthesis [progressive rock]; it involved more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock and roll as material (much as pop artists used mass art in general) and refining, elaborating, playing off that material to produce … rockand-roll art. While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock and roll was or could be as worthy as more established art forms, rock-and-roll art came out of an obsessive commitment to the language of rock and roll and an equally obsessive disdain for those who rejected that language or wanted it watered down, made easier … the new wave has inherited the counter-tradition.[14]

Art rock emphasizes Romantic and autonomous traditions, in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop.[15] Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman's American Popular Music defines art rock as a ""form of rock music that blended elements of rock and European classical music"", citing the English rock bands King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Pink Floyd as examples.[16] Common characteristics include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs, with usually complicated and long instrumental sections and symphonic orchestration.[3] Its music was traditionally used within the context of concept records, and its lyrical themes tended to be ""imaginative"" and politically oriented.[3]

Differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock, with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or experimental influences and ""novel sonic structure"", while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique, literary content, and symphonic features.[1] Compared to progressive rock, art rock is ""more challenging, noisy and unconventional"" and ""less classically influenced"", with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music.[1] Similarities are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility,[1] and became the instrumental analog to concept albums and rock operas, which were typically more vocal oriented.[17]

Art rock can also refer to either classically driven rock, or to a progressive rock-folk fusion.[3] Bruce Eder's essay The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock states that ""'progressive rock,' also sometimes known as 'art rock,' or 'classical rock'"" is music in which the ""bands [are] playing suites, not songs; borrowing riffs from Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner instead of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley; and using language closer to William Blake or T. S. Eliot than to Carl Perkins or Willie Dixon.""[18]

In the late sixties and early seventies, rock both co-opted and challenged the prevailing view of musical art, often at the same time. This is evident in a diverse body of music that includes the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper; Frank Zappa's Freak Out ... the Who's rock opera Tommy; Pink Floyd's technologically advanced concept album Dark Side of the Moon; and Miles Davis's jazz/rock fusion.

—Michael Campbell, Popular Music in America, 2012[12]

The boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century.[19] The first usage of the term ""art rock"", according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, was in 1968.[4] As pop music's dominant format transitioned from singles to albums,[nb 1] many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements, where art rock would flourish.[21] As it progressed in the late 1960s – in tandem with the development of progressive rock – art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock.[22]

The earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter Phil Spector, who became known as an auteur for his Wall of Sound productions that aspired to a ""classical grandiosity"".[23] According to biographer Richard Williams: ""[Spector] created a new concept: the producer as the overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.""[24] Williams also says that Spector transformed rock music from a performing art into an art that could only exist in the recording studio, which ""paved the way for art rock"".[25]

The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is also cited as one of the first examples of the auteur music producer.[26][nb 2] Like Spector, Wilson was known as a reclusive studio obsessive who laboriously produced fantastical soundscapes through his mastery of recording technology.[28] Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of ""a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music"".[29] Drawing from the influence of Wilson's work and the work of the Beatles' producer George Martin, music producers after the mid 1960s began to view the recording studio as a musical instrument used to aid the process of composition.[26] Critic Stephen Holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the Beatles, Spector and Wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop, which preceded the ""bombastic, classically inflected"" art rock that started in the late 1960s.[21]

Many of the top British groups during the 1960s – including members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, 10cc, the Move, the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd – came to music via art school.[30][31] This institution differed from its US counterpart in terms of having a less industry-applicable syllabus and in its focus on furthering eccentric talent.[32] By the mid-1960s, several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality, where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of US-derived musical styles, such as rock 'n' roll and R&B.[33]

According to journalist Richard Goldstein, many popular musicians from California (like Wilson) desired to be acknowledged as artists, and struggled with this aspiration. Goldstein says that the line between violating musical conventions and making ""truly popular music"" caused those who did not have ""strong enough egos"" (in contrast to Bob Dylan and the Beatles) to be ""doomed to a respectful rejection, and a few albums with disappointing sales usually meant silence. ... They yearned for fame, as only needy people can, but they also wanted to make art, and when both of those impulses couldn't be achieved they recoiled in a ball of frantic confusion.""[34]

Author Matthew Bannister traces ""the more self-conscious, camp aesthetic of art rock"" to pop artist Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, who emulated Warhol's art/pop synthesis.[35] Accordingly: ""Warhol took Spector's combination of the disembodiment, 'distance' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ... But Warhol's aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than Spector's, which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern, detached tenets of pop art. ... Warhol's approach reverberates throughout art rock, most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement.""[36] In 1969, the Doors also explored art rock genre on their fourth album, The Soft Parade.[37]

The December 1965 release of the Beatles' Rubber Soul signified a watershed for the pop album,[38] transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form, filled with high-quality original compositions.[39] The album garnered recognition for the Beatles as artists from the American mainstream press,[40] anticipating rock music's cultural legitimization as an art form.[41] Writing in 1968, Gene Sculatti of Jazz & Pop recognized Rubber Soul as ""the definitive 'rock as art' album"" and ""the necessary prototype"" that major artists such as the Rolling Stones (with Aftermath) and the Beach Boys had felt compelled to follow.[42]

The period when rock music became most closely aligned with art began in 1966 and continued until the mid 1970s.[43] Academic Michael Johnson associates ""the first documented moments of ascension in rock music"" to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Released in May 1966, Pet Sounds came from Wilson's desire to make a ""complete statement"", as he believed the Beatles had previously done with Rubber Soul.[44][nb 3] In 1978, biographer David Leaf wrote that the album heralded art rock,[46] while according to The New York Observer, ""Pet Sounds proved that a pop group could make an album-length piece comparable with the greatest long-form works of Bernstein, Copland, Ives, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.""[47]Pet Sounds is also noted as the first rock concept album.[48][49][nb 4] In 1971, Cue magazine described the Beach Boys as having been ""among the vanguard"" with regard to art rock, among many other aspects relating to the counterculture, over the period up to late 1967.[50]

Jacqueline Edmondson's 2013 encyclopedia Music in American Life states that, although it was preceded by earlier examples, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention's debut album Freak Out! (June 1966) came to be seen as ""the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context"". With Los Angeles as his base since the early 1960s, Zappa was able to work in an environment where student radicalism was closely aligned with an active avant-garde scene, a setting that placed the city ahead of other countercultural centres at the time and would continue to inform his music.[19] Writer and pianist Michael Campbell comments that the album ""contains a long noncategorical list of Zappa's influences, from classical avant-garde composers to obscure folk musicians"".[12]

The Beatles' Revolver (August 1966) furthered the album-as-art perspective[51] and continued pop music's evolution.[52] Led by the art-rock single ""Eleanor Rigby"",[53] it expanded the genre's scope in terms of the range of musical styles, which included Indian, avant-garde and classical, and the lyrical content of the album,[54] and also in its departure from previous notions of melody and structure in pop songwriting.[55] According to Rolling Stone, ""Revolver signaled that in popular music, anything – any theme, any musical idea – could now be realized.""[56] As with Rubber Soul, the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s,[57] and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style.[58]

Clash Music names the Velvet Underground's debut March 1967 album The Velvet Underground & Nico ""the original art-rock record"".[59][nb 5] Bannister writes of the Velvet Underground: ""no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists, writers and audiences.""[61] Their influence would recur from the 1970s onwards to various worldwide indie scenes,[61][nb 6] and in 2006, The Velvet Underground & Nico was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry, who commented: ""For decades [it] has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock, from 70s art-rock to no-wave, new-wave, and punk.""[62] However, when the Velvet Underground first appeared in the mid 1960s, they faced rejection and were commonly dismissed as a ""fag"" band.[63] In 1982, musician Brian Eno famously stated that while The Velvet Underground & Nico initially sold just 30,000 copies, ""everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.""[64]

The Beatles' Paul McCartney deemed Pet Sounds ""the record of the time"", and in June 1967, the band responded with their own album: Sgt. Pepper's,[65][nb 7] which was also influenced by Freak Out![66]AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by Sgt. Pepper's and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre.[1][nb 8] Many British groups flowered in the album's wake; those who are listed in Music in American Life include the Moody Blues, the Strawbs, Genesis, and ""most notably"", Pink Floyd.[68][nb 9] The band's Roger Waters later stated that both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds ""completely changed everything about records"" for him.[70]

Art rock's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists including King Crimson and Queen.[3]

Early in the decade, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother, with the 23-minute title track taking up the entire first side of the LP. This experiment with collaborator Ron Geesin yielded the longest unbroken Pink Floyd song on record, a suite divided into six parts, which required the band at times to utilize a choir and brass section on tour. The album was a commercial success, giving the band to its first number one record in the UK. It signaled a shift in their music from the psychedelic forays of their late '60s albums and into a period of renewed creativity in the form of longer and more progressive rock music.

Enthusiasm for art rock explorations waned in the mid 1970s.[12] From then to the 1990s, art rock was infused within various popular music genres.[3]Encyclopædia Britannica states that its genre's tendencies were continued by some British and American hard rock and pop rock artists, and that Brian Eno's late 1970s and early 1980s collaborations with David Bowie and Talking Heads are exemplary of ""the successful infusion of art rock tendencies into other popular music genres"".[3] Bowie and Eno collaborated on a series of consecutive albums called the ""Berlin Trilogy"", characterized as an ""art rock trifecta"" by Consequence of Sound, who noted that at the time of their release, ""The experimental records weren't connecting with audiences on the scale Bowie was used to. ... New Wave had exploded, and a generation of Bowie descendants had taken the stage.""[71]

In the 1980s, a new generation of English art rockers took the place of 1970s bands such as Roxy Music,[72]Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Journalist Roy Trakin says: ""Of course, these stalwarts can still fill Madison Square Garden and sell a great many records, as they always have, but their days of adventurous risk-taking and musical innovation are long gone – replaced by the smug satisfaction of commercial success.""[73]"
"Garage rock","Garage rock (sometimes called garage punk or '60s punk) is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada, and has experienced a series of subsequent revivals. The style is characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars and other instruments, sometimes distorted through a fuzzbox, as well as often unsophisticated and occasionally aggressive lyrics and delivery. Its name derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional.
In the US and Canada, surf rock—and later the Beatles and other beat groups of the British Invasion—motivated thousands of young people to form bands between 1963 and 1968. Hundreds of grass-roots acts produced regional hits, some of which gained national popularity, usually played on AM radio stations. With the advent of psychedelia, numerous garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre's primitive stylistic framework. After 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music came to dominate the marketplace, garage rock records largely disappeared from national and regional charts, and the movement faded. Other countries in the 1960s experienced similar rock movements that have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock.
During the 1960s, garage rock was not recognized as a distinct genre and had no specific name, but critical hindsight in the early 1970s—and especially the 1972 compilation album Nuggets—did much to define and memorialize the style. Between 1971 and 1973, certain American rock critics began to retroactively identify the music as a genre and for several years used the term punk rock to describe it, making it the first form of music to bear the description, predating the more familiar use of the term appropriated by the later punk rock movement that it influenced. The term garage rock gained favor amongst commentators and devotees during the 1980s. The style has also been referred to as proto-punk, or, in certain instances, frat rock.
In the early to mid-1980s, several revival scenes emerged featuring acts that consciously attempted to replicate the look and sound of 1960s garage bands. Later in the decade, a louder, more contemporary garage subgenre developed that combined garage rock with modern punk rock and other influences, sometimes using the garage punk label originally and otherwise associated with 1960s garage bands. In the 2000s, a wave of garage-influenced acts associated with the post-punk revival emerged, and some achieved commercial success. Garage rock continues to appeal to musicians and audiences who prefer a back to basics or do-it-yourself musical approach."
"Glam rock","

Glam rock is a style of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was performed by male musicians who wore flamboyant and feminine clothing, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter, and female musicians who wore masculine clothing.[1][2][3] Glam artists drew on diverse sources across music and throwaway pop culture,[4] ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret, science fiction, and complex art rock.[5][6] The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with other gender roles.[7]Glitter rock was a more extreme version of glam rock.[8]

The UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975.[9] The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC's music show Top of the Pops—performing ""Hot Love""—wearing glitter and satins, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists included David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter. Though not central to the genre, artists such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Freddie Mercury of Queen, also adopted glam styles.[10] In the United States, the scene was much less prevalent, with Alice Cooper and Lou Reed the only American artists to score a hit in the UK.[9] Other American glam artists include New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop and Jobriath. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, glam metal, death rock and gothic rock. The New Romantic movement, which began as an underground fashion subculture movement in nightclubs in the late 1970s before becoming mainstream in the early 80s, was also inspired by the visuals of the glam rock era.

Glam rock can be seen as a fashion as well as musical subgenre.[11] Glam artists rejected the revolutionary rhetoric of the late 1960s rock scene, instead glorifying decadence, superficiality, and the simple structures of earlier pop music.[12][13] In response to these characteristics, scholars such as I.Taylor and D. Wall characterised glam rock as ""offensive, commercial, and cultural emasculation"".[14]

Artists drew on such musical influences as bubblegum pop, the brash guitar riffs of hard rock, stomping rhythms, and 1950s rock and roll, filtering them through the recording innovations of the late 1960s.[12][15][16] Ultimately, it became very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art pop of Roxy Music.[11] In its beginning, however, it was a youth-orientated reaction to the creeping dominance of progressive rock and concept albums – what Bomp! called the ""overall denim dullness"" of ""a deadly boring, prematurely matured music scene"".[17]

Visually, it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamour, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.[6] Glam rock is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics.[18]

It was prefigured by the flamboyant English composer Noël Coward, especially his 1931 song ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"", with music writer Daryl Easlea stating, ""Noël Coward's influence on people like Bowie, Roxy Music and Cockney Rebel was absolutely immense. It suggested style, artifice and surface were equally as important as depth and substance. Time magazine noted Coward's 'sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise'. It reads like a glam manifesto.""[19] Showmanship and gender identity manipulation acts included the Cockettes and Alice Cooper, the latter of which combined glam with shock rock.[20]

Glam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and a reaction against, those trends.[11] Its origins are associated with Marc Bolan, who had renamed his acoustic duo T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s.[17] Bolan was, in the words of music critic Ken Barnes, ""the man who started it all"".[17] Often cited as the moment of inception is Bolan's appearance on the BBC music show Top of the Pops in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), ""Hot Love"".[21]The Independent states that Bolan's appearance on Top of the Pops ""permitted a generation of teeny-boppers to begin playing with the idea of androgyny"".[19] T. Rex's 1971 album Electric Warrior received critical acclaim as a pioneering glam rock album.[22] In 1973, a few months after the release of the album Tanx, Bolan captured the front cover of Melody Maker magazine with the declaration ""Glam rock is dead!""[23]

From late 1971, already a minor star, David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional makeup, mime and performance into his act.[10] Bowie, in a 1972 interview in which he noted that other artists described as glam rock were doing different work, said ""I think glam rock is a lovely way to categorize me and it's even nicer to be one of the leaders of it"".[24] Bolan and Bowie were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, Sweet, Slade, Mott the Hoople, Mud and Alvin Stardust.[10] The popularity of glam rock in the UK was such that three glam rock bands had major UK Christmas hit singles; ""Merry Xmas Everybody"" by Slade, ""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday"" by Wizzard and ""Lonely This Christmas"" by Mud, all of which have remained hugely popular.[25][26] Glam was not only a highly successful trend in UK popular music, it became dominant in other aspects of British popular culture during the 1970s.[9]

A heavier variant of glam rock, emphasising guitar riff centric songs, driving rhythms and live performance with audience participation, were represented by bands like Slade and Mott the Hoople, with later followers such as Def Leppard, Cheap Trick, Poison, Kiss, and Quiet Riot, some of which either covered Slade compositions (such as ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"") or composed new songs based on Slade templates.[27] While highly successful in the single charts in the UK (Slade for example had six number one singles), very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the US; David Bowie was the major exception, becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as ""glitter rock"" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.[28]

In the UK, the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and the independent band with whom he often performed known as the Glitter Band. The Glitter Band and Gary Glitter had between them eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1975.[8] A second wave of glam rock acts, including Suzi Quatro, Roy Wood's Wizzard and Sparks, had hits on the British single charts in 1973 and 1974.[10][29] Quatro and T.Rex directly inspired the pioneering Los Angeles based all-girl group The Runaways.[30] Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including Rod Stewart, Elton John, Queen and, for a time, the Rolling Stones.[10] After seeing Marc Bolan wearing Zandra Rhodes-designed outfits, Freddie Mercury enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next Queen tour in 1974.[31]Punk rock, in part a reaction to the artifice of glam rock, but using some elements of the genre, including makeup and involving cover versions of glam rock records,[32] helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976.[28]

While glam rock was exclusively a British cultural phenomenon, with Steven Wells in The Guardian writing ""Americans only got glam second hand via the posh Bowie version"", covers of British glam rock classics are now piped-muzak staples at US sporting events.[34] Glam rock was a background influence for Richard O'Brien, writer of the 1973 London musical The Rocky Horror Show.[35] Although glam rock went into a steep decline in popularity in the UK in the second half of the 1970s, it had a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including Kiss and American glam metal acts like Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Ratt.[36]

New Romantic acts in the UK such as Adam and the Ants and A Flock of Seagulls extended glam, and its androgyny and sexual politics were picked up by acts including Culture Club, Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.[37]Gothic rock was largely informed by the makeup, clothes, theatricality and sound of glam, and punk rock adopted some of the performance and persona-creating tendencies of glam, as well as the genre's emphasis on pop-art qualities and simple but powerful instrumentation.[28]

Glam rock has been influential around the world.[38] In Japan in the 1980s, visual kei was strongly influenced by glam rock aesthetics.[39] Glam rock has since enjoyed continued influence and sporadic modest revivals in R&B crossover act Prince,[40] bands such as Marilyn Manson, Suede, Placebo,[41]Chainsaw Kittens, Spacehog and the Darkness,[42] and has inspired pop artists such as Lady Gaga.[43]

Its self-conscious embrace of fame and ego continues to reverberate through pop music decades after the death of its prototypical superstar, Marc Bolan of T. Rex, in 1977. As an elastic concept rather than a fixed stratosphere of '70s personalities, it is even equipped to survive the loss of its most enduring artist, David Bowie.

Movies that reflect glam rock aesthetics include:"
"Hard rock","Hard rock or heavy rock[1] is a heavier subgenre of rock music typified by aggressive vocals and distorted electric guitars. Hard rock began in the mid-1960s with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. Some of the earliest hard rock music was produced by the Kinks, the Who, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Vanilla Fudge, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the late 1960s, bands such as Blue Cheer, the Jeff Beck Group, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Golden Earring, Steppenwolf, and Deep Purple also produced hard rock.
The genre developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with the Who, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple being joined by Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Kiss, Queen, AC/DC, Thin Lizzy and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock.[2][3] Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s with glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard as well as the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses which followed with great success in the later part of that decade.
Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R&B, hip-hop, urban pop, grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and later the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.
Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument.[5] Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis.[6] The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars.[7] Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.[8]
In the late-1960s, the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity.[9] While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them.[5] In the 1980s, heavy metal developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles.[7] Despite this differentiation, hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side, with bands frequently standing on the boundary of, or crossing between, the genres.[10]"
"Heartland rock","

Heartland rock is a genre of rock music characterized by a straightforward, often roots musical style, often with a focus on blue-collar workers, and a conviction that rock music has a social or communal purpose beyond just entertainment.

The genre is exemplified by singer-songwriters Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, and John Mellencamp and country music artists, including Steve Earle and Joe Ely.[1] The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success.

The term heartland rock was not coined to describe a clear genre until the 1980s.[2] In terms of style, it often uses straightforward rock music, sometimes with elements of Americana with a basic rhythm and blues line-up of drums, keyboards and occasional horn section instruments like a saxophone. However, this common definition may represent an oversimplification given that Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. made heavy use of synthesizers,[3] most notably on the hit singles ""Dancing in the Dark"", ""Glory Days"" and the title track. Lyrics are often presented in a style that is raspy and unpolished, adding a sense of authenticity.[4] The genre was most strongly influenced by American country, folk, 1960s garage rock, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and folk rock acts such as Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie,[5]Creedence Clearwater Revival, and the Byrds.[6]

Verses in heartland rock songs often tell stories. In some songs, those stories are about people undergoing hard times; choruses are often anthemic in tone.[7] The genre is associated with working-class regions of the Midwest and the Rust Belt.[8] It has been characterized as a predominantly romantic genre, celebrating ""urban backstreets and rooftops"",[9] and its major themes include alienation, despair, ""unemployment, small-town decline, disillusionment, limited opportunity and bitter nostalgia"".[7][10]

Many major heartland rock artists began their careers in the 1960s, as with Bob Seger, or the 1970s, as with Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers; the former after two critically highly regarded but modestly selling albums with the E Street Band, he achieved his breakthrough in 1975 with Born to Run,[11] which presented stories of loss, betrayal, defeat and escape in the context of his native New Jersey shoreline, with songs influenced by 50s rock and roll, Dylan and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound.[12] While Springsteen struggled for three years with legal disputes, other artists in a similar vein came to the fore. These artists included Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.[11]

In 1978, Springsteen returned with Darkness on the Edge of Town, which reached the top ten in the US and then the number one album The River (1980), which continued the themes of economic and personal dissolution, produced a series of hit singles,[11] and has been seen as ""getting the heartland rock bandwagon rolling"", together with the stripped-down sound and darker themes of his next album Nebraska (1982).[7]

The genre reached its commercial peak with Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. in 1984.[13] The 1980s saw the arrival of new artists such as John Mellencamp, Bruce Hornsby & the Range, Iron City Houserockers, John Hiatt, Lucinda Williams,[14] and BoDeans.[15] A number of roots music and country music artists like Steve Earle,[16]The Tractors, The Hot Club of Cowtown, and Joe Ely also became associated with the genre.[17]

The first significant female artist in the genre was Melissa Etheridge, whose self-titled debut album issued in 1988 drew critical comparisons with Springsteen and Mellencamp.[4][18]

In the 1990s, many artists who would have been heartland rockers in the 1980s chose to pursue the recently emerged genre of Americana,[19] and heartland rock dwindled to a few stalwart artists.[20]

Heartland rock can be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel[7] and Kid Rock, who recorded a duet with Seger for the latter's Face the Promise album.[21] Kid Rock's 2008 hit ""All Summer Long"" was inspired by Seger's classic ""Night Moves"" as well as ""Sweet Home Alabama"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd and ""Werewolves of London"" by Warren Zevon. Music critic Anthony DeCurtis wrote that on Rock n Roll Jesus, Rock ""extends the Seger-Mellencamp tradition of heartland rock"".[22] American indie rock bands the Killers, the Menzingers, and the War on Drugs have been associated with the genre.[23][24]

British band Dire Straits and English singer-songwriter Sam Fender are known to have established their ""British version"" of the heartland rock genre.[25]"
"Modern rock","Modern rock is an umbrella term used to describe rock music that is found on college and commercial rock radio stations. Some radio stations use this term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which is based in 1960s–1980s rock music.

Modern rock (also known as alternative radio) is a rock format commonly found on commercial radio; the format consists primarily of the alternative rock genre.[1]  Generally beginning with Hardcore punk but referring especially to alternative rock music since the 1980s, the phrase ""modern rock"" is used in the US to differentiate the music from classic rock, which focuses on music recorded in the 1960s through to the early 1990s.

A few modern rock radio stations existed during the 1980s, such as KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, XETRA-FM in San Diego, WHTG-FM (now WKMK) on the Jersey Shore, WLIR on Long Island, WFNX in Boston, and KQAK The Quake in San Francisco.[1] Modern rock was solidified as a radio format in 1988 with Billboard's creation of the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The chart was based on weighted reports from college radio stations and commercial stations such as those listed above.[2] The 1988 episode of the VH1 show I Love the '80s discussed INXS, the Cure, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, and Erasure as modern rock artists representative of that year. But it was the breakthrough success of the grunge bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam in 1991 that resulted in many American radio stations switching to the format.[1] Modern rock is considered by some to be a specific genre of alternative rock.[3]

The format has gone through two distinct periods, dividing the line from classic modern rock and the current alternative rock format used today. Up until grunge went mainstream, the format featured a wide variety of up-tempo danceable music from a diverse group of artists that were being played in rock discos and clubs.[2] This was a legacy from new wave music and the Second British Invasion that immediately  preceded it.[2] Of all the artists who had songs hit the top 30 in the first modern rock chart, only seven of them were American.[2]  Between 1992 and 1994, most of the female, foreign and dance music had largely disappeared from the chart.[2] While the chart still featured a variety of alternative rock music, it was largely guitar rock created by male Americans.[2] By 1996, the modern rock chart was largely identical to the mainstream rock chart; it was therefore surveying what was then mainstream rock music.[2]

For most of the 2000s, modern rock radio stations mostly featured songs that were crossed over from the active rock format. This was often famous for the second wave of post-grunge and nu metal scenes that derived from grunge and alternative metal music, respectively, in the 1990s. During the early 2000s, these two genres made up most of the modern rock format, despite the format being a heavily diverse format genre-wise (for example, in 2003, it was not uncommon to hear diverse artists like Jack Johnson, Muse, Coheed and Cambria, The Postal Service, The Mars Volta, Junior Senior, Snow Patrol, Story of the Year, The Black Keys, and Kings of Leon all played on the same modern rock station). By the mid-2000s, the two genres were dropped, and the revivals of genres such as post-punk, garage rock, noise rock, and dance-punk (often tagged in as the post-punk revival of that time) took its place but the post-grunge and nu metal genres still had some success.

In the 2010s, modern rock served as an indie-driven radio format featuring new, young and recent indie rock bands and artists. Ranging from genres like reggae, folk, hip hop and EDM, common indie rock artists heard on the format included Young the Giant, Of Monsters and Men, Atlas Genius, The Neighbourhood, Arcade Fire, Weezer, Twenty One Pilots, The 1975, Arctic Monkeys and Bastille.

Near the end of the 2010s, the popularity and amount of indie rock acts began to decline. In their place, many modern rock radio stations began playing crossover pop artists including Billie Eilish, AJR, Post Malone, Glass Animals, The Kid Laroi, and Machine Gun Kelly, among others. New music from heritage acts like Foo Fighters, Blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Killers, Weezer, and The Black Keys pulled the format back towards its roots in the mid-2020s. Newer artists heard on alternative stations during this period include Måneskin, Lovelytheband, White Reaper, The Struts, and Noah Kahan.

In addition, several alternative radio stations shifted to a Classic alternative playlist in the early 2020s, focusing on music primarily from the 1980s and 1990s. Stations include XETRA-FM in San Diego, WNNX in Atlanta, and WOLT in Indianapolis."
"Psychedelic rock","Psychedelic rock is a rock music genre that is inspired, influenced, or representative of psychedelic culture, which is centered on perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs. The music incorporated new electronic sound effects and recording techniques, extended instrumental solos, and improvisation.[2] Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often applied spuriously.[3]
Originating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sound of psychedelic rock invokes three core effects of LSD: depersonalization, dechronicization (the bending of time), and dynamization (when fixed, ordinary objects dissolve into moving, dancing structures), all of which detach the user from everyday reality.[3] Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty studio tricks, electronic or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and extended instrumental segments.[4] Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were based in folk, jazz, and the blues, while others showcased an explicit Indian classical influence called raga rock. In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast acid rock. While acid rock is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term psychedelic rock, it also refers more specifically to the heavier, harder, and more extreme ends of the genre.
The peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Festival, becoming an international musical movement associated with a widespread counterculture before declining as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, and as a result contributed to the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia."
"Alternative metal","

Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal)[4] is a genre of heavy metal music that combines heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal.[5][6] Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles.[5] The term has been in use since the 1980s,[7] although it came into prominence in the 1990s.[8]

Other genres considered part of the alternative metal movement included rap metal[5][9] and funk metal, both of which influenced another prominent subgenre, nu metal. Nu metal expands the alternative metal sound, combining its vocal stylings and downtuned riffs with elements of other genres, such as hip hop, funk, thrash metal, hardcore punk and industrial metal.

Alternative metal began in the 1980s with bands like Faith No More, Living Colour, Soundgarden, and Jane's Addiction. The genre achieved success in the 1990s with the popularity of bands like Helmet, Tool, and Alice in Chains. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal achieved mainstream popularity with the mainstream success of bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, P.O.D., Papa Roach, Disturbed, Godsmack, System of a Down, Linkin Park, Slipknot, and Staind. After 2003, nu metal's popularity began to decline, with bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit and P.O.D. experiencing a decline in album sales and many nu metal bands moving on to other genres. Nonetheless, alternative metal's popularity continued in the mid–late 2000s with the continued success of bands like Disturbed, Godsmack and System of a Down and the mainstream success of emerging bands like Evanescence, Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin.

The genre is generally considered a fusion between alternative rock and heavy metal,[6] although AllMusic states ""alt-metal is a far-reaching term that has been used to describe everyone from Hammerlock to Neurosis to Ministry to Limp Bizkit"".[10] They also remarked that alternative metal was originally ""a style united by its nonconformist sensibility rather than any immediately classifiable sound.""[5]

One of the main characteristics of alternative metal and its subgenres are heavily downtuned, mid-paced ""chug""-like guitar riffs.[11][12][13] However, funk metal bands often use a more conventional riffing style influenced by 1980s thrash metal.[14] Alternative metal features clean and melodic vocals,[4] influenced by those of alternative rock, in contrast to other heavy metal subgenres. Later bands frequently incorporated vocal styles that alternated between clean singing, growls and screaming.[6][15][16][17] Examples include alternative metal bands associated with the nu metal movement, such as Korn and Deftones, who have been described as having ""bipolar vocals"".[18][19]

Jonathan Gold of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1990 ""Just as rock has an alternative, [left] wing-bands like the Replacements and Dinosaur Jr.-so does metal. Alternative metal is alternative music that rocks. And alternative metal these days can reach 10 times the audience of other alternative rock. Jane's Addiction plays an intense brand of '70s-influenced arty metal; so does Soundgarden. In fact, the arty meanderings of Sabbath and Zeppelin themselves would be considered alternative metal.""[20]Houston Press has described the genre as being a ""compromise for people for whom Nirvana was not heavy enough but Metallica was too heavy.""[21]

The first wave of alternative metal bands emerged from many backgrounds, including hardcore punk (Bad Brains, Rollins Band, Life of Agony, Corrosion of Conformity), noise rock (Helmet, the Jesus Lizard, Today Is the Day), Seattle's grunge scene (Alice in Chains, Soundgarden), stoner rock (Clutch, Kyuss), sludge metal (Fudge Tunnel, Melvins), gothic metal (Type O Negative), groove metal (Pantera, White Zombie) and industrial (Godflesh, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry).[5][22][23][24][25][26][27] These bands never formed a distinct movement or scene; rather they were bound by their incorporation of traditional metal influences and openness to experimentation.[5]Jane's Addiction borrowed from art rock[20] and progressive rock, Quicksand blended post-hardcore and Living Colour injected funk into their sound, for example,[5][28] while Primus were influenced by progressive rock,[5]thrash metal[29] and funk[30] and Faith No More mixed progressive rock, R&B, funk and hip hop.[31]Fudge Tunnel's style of alternative metal included influences from both sludge metal and noise rock.[25][32]

The origins of the genre can be traced back to funk rock music of the early to mid-1980s, when alternative bands like Fishbone, Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers started mixing heavy metal with funk, creating the alternative metal subgenre funk metal.[33] Other early bands in the genre also came from hardcore punk backgrounds.[34] Bands such as Faith No More, Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden are recognized as some of the earliest alternative metal acts, with all three of these bands emerging around the same time, and setting the template for the genre by mixing heavy metal music with a variety of different genres in the mid to late 1980s.[5][35][36][37][38] During the 1980s, alternative metal appealed mainly to alternative rock fans, since virtually all 1980s alt-metal bands had their roots in the American independent rock scene.[5]Living Colour was another alternative metal band that combined the genre with funk metal.[5] Faith No More and Living Colour both achieved brief mainstream success with their albums The Real Thing (1989)[39] and Vivid (1988),[40] which went platinum and double platinum, respectively.

The emergence of grunge as a popular style of rock music in the early 1990s helped make alternative metal more acceptable to a mainstream audience, with alternative metal soon becoming the most popular metal style of the 1990s.[5] Several bands associated with the genre denied their status as metal bands.[41][42]Helmet drummer John Stanier said ""We fell into the whole metal thing by accident, we always hated it when people mentioned metal in conjunction with us.""[42] Helmet's Meantime (1992) album became one of the most influential heavy metal albums of the 1990s.[43] Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Pitchfork Media stated ""bands like Faith No More, Soundgarden, Primus, Helmet, the Rollins Band, and dozens more were initially marketed as quasi-metal acts. This was only possible in a climate where record labels, journalists, and college radio DJs understood that the metal audience could embrace new, albeit arty variations on the form.""[44] The alternative music festival Lollapalooza conceived by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell, helped bands associated with the movement such as Tool, Rage Against the Machine, Primus, Nine Inch Nails, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains gain exposure.[5] The progressive rock-influenced band Tool became a leading band in the alternative metal genre with the release of their 1993 debut album Undertow; Tool's popularity in the mid-'90s helped kick off an era of bands with alt-metal tendencies also classified in other genres like industrial (Nine Inch Nails) and rap rock (Rage Against the Machine).[4]Spin stated in August 1998 that ""It was Helmet that spawned the idea of alternative metal with the punk crutch of 1992's Meantime [and] bands such as Rage Against the Machine took the concept a crucial step further, integrating hip hop to connect with skate rat kids raised on Metallica and Run D.M.C.""[45] Many established 1980s metal bands released albums in the 1990s that were described as alternative metal, including Anthrax,[46]Metallica[47][48] and Mötley Crüe.[49]Marilyn Manson achieved mainstream success in the mid-late 1990s starting with his 1996 album Antichrist Superstar, which went platinum in the United States.[50] Bands like Life of Agony combined alternative metal with hardcore punk influences.[5] Life of Agony's debut album River Runs Red combined alternative metal with influences of hardcore punk, with lyrics about depression and suicide.[51]

In the latter part of the 1990s, a second, more aggressive wave of alternative metal emerged; dubbed nu metal, it often relied on hardcore punk,[5]groove/thrash metal,[5][52]industrial[5] and hip hop[5] influences, as opposed to the influences of the first wave of alternative metal bands, with this style subsequently becoming more popular than regular alternative metal.[4][5][22] It resulted in a more standardized sound among alternative metal bands, in contrast to the more eccentric and unclassifiable early alternative metal bands.[5]Korn, a band formed in 1993, released their self-titled debut the following year, which is widely considered to be the first nu metal release.[53]MTV stated that Korn ""arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock.""[54]Stereogum similarly claimed that nu metal was a ""weird outgrowth of the Lollapalooza-era alt-metal scene"".[55] During the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal was prevalent in the mainstream, with bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot and Staind all attaining success. AllMusic has compared nu and alternative metal's commercial success during this period to the rise of the glam metal phenomenon in the 1980s, stating that it is ""ironic, given alternative metal's vehement rejection of hair metal's attitude.""[5] Some nu metal bands managed to push musical boundaries while still remaining commercially viable, such as Mudvayne (who combined progressive[56] elements) and Deftones, who have incorporated post-hardcore and dream pop influences.[57][58]

Korn's 1998 album Follow the Leader and 1999 album Issues sold 3.6 million and 3.2 million copies in the United States, respectively, and the band's 2002 album Untouchables sold 1.4 million. Korn's eponymous debut (1994) and second album Life is Peachy (1996) sold 2.1 million and 1.8 million copies, respectively.[59] Limp Bizkit's Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000) sold over seven million and six million, respectively.[60] Korn and Limp Bizkit were frequently featured on MTV, often hitting number 1 and having multiple retired videos on the popular MTV show Total Request Live, competing on the show with boy bands like N'Sync and Backstreet Boys.[61]Papa Roach's album Infest (2000) went triple platinum and was supported by the hit single ""Last Resort"".[57] Bands like P.O.D. and Linkin Park also had widespread popularity,[57] with Linkin Park's 2000 album Hybrid Theory being certified diamond in the United States, bringing nu metal to its peak popularity.[62] Bands like Staind, Godsmack, Disturbed and System of a Down also achieved multi-platinum mainstream success with the albums Break the Cycle (2001),[63]Godsmack (1998),[64]The Sickness (2000)[65] and Toxicity (2001),[66] respectively.

Joel McIver believes that the band Tool is important to the development of this genre; he wrote in his book Unleashed: The Story of Tool, ""By 1996 and '97 the wave of alternative metal spearheaded by Tool in the wake of grunge was beginning to evolve into nu-metal"". However, Tool's vocalist Maynard James Keenan was quick to separate himself from this movement saying ""I'm sick of that whole attitude. The one that puts Tool in with [nu] metal bands. The press... can't seem to distinguish between alternative and metal.""[41] Other alternative metal bands considered influential to the nu metal genre such as Helmet have also tried to distance themselves from the movement.[67][68]

In 2004, nu metal's popularity was declining, with bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit and P.O.D. having a decline in album sales. Instead, post-grunge bands like Nickelback were selling the most records and being promoted the most on radio.[69] Additionally, many nu metal bands began to move away from the nu metal genre and moved on to other genres.[57] Nonetheless, the popularity of alternative metal persisted throughout the 2000s with the success of several bands. Evanescence's 2003 album Fallen went 7× platinum in the United States.[70] Godsmack, Disturbed and System of a Down also continued in popularity with number 1 albums. Bands like Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin also broke into the mainstream, with Three Days Grace achieving multiple hit singles, including the song ""Animal I Have Become"".

In 2016, Jason Heller of Vice wrote ""The term alternative metal still pops up from time to time, but it’s no more relevant or meaningful today than alternative rock. Instead, it’s a relic. But the brief, nebulous era of alternative metal in the late 80s and early 90s remains a snapshot of a vibrant time when a brash new generation of heavy-leaning bands threw everything against the wall to see what stuck.""[71]"
"Nu metal","Nu metal (sometimes stylized as nü-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, funk, industrial, and grunge. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of musical technique, and emphasizes rhythm with instrumentation that is heavily syncopated. Nu metal guitarists typically use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to produce a heavier sound. Vocal styles are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop, and include singing, rapping, screaming and sometimes growling. DJs are occasionally featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic background music. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new wave of American heavy metal.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like Pantera, Helmet, and Faith No More were influential in the development of nu metal with their groove metal and alternative metal styles. Korn is often credited as pioneering the genre in the mid-1990s. Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s, with bands and artists such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Its popularity continued through the early 2000s, with bands such as Papa Roach, Staind, and P.O.D. all selling multi-platinum albums. The popularity of nu metal came to a peak with Linkin Park's diamond-selling album Hybrid Theory, which became the best-selling rock album of the 21st century. By the mid-2000s, however, the oversaturation of bands combined with the underperformance of several high-profile releases led to nu metal's decline, leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.

The 2010s brought a nu metal revival; many bands that combined nu metal with other genres (for example, metalcore and deathcore) emerged, and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu metal sound. Bands such as Of Mice & Men, Emmure, Issues, My Ticket Home, and Bring Me the Horizon combined nu metal with metalcore or deathcore. Artists like Grimes, Poppy, and Rina Sawayama integrated nu metal sounds into electronic pop music in the late 2010s and early 2020s, and interest in nu metal rose in the early 2020s.

Nu metal is a subgenre of alternative metal.[4][5] Sometimes stylized as nü-metal,[6][7] the genre has also been dubbed aggro-metal.[4][8]MTV states that the early nu metal group Korn ""arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock.""[5]Stereogum similarly said that nu metal was a ""weird outgrowth of the Lollapalooza-era alt-metal scene"".[9] Nu metal merges elements of heavy metal music[4][10][11] with elements of other music genres such as hip hop,[4][12]grunge, funk,[4][10][13][14][15][16] and alternative rock according to Blabbermouth.net.[17] Nu metal bands use many elements of heavy metal genres such as rap metal, groove metal, and funk metal.[4][13][18] Some nu metal bands, such as Static-X[19] and Dope,[20] made nu metal music with elements of industrial metal. In contrast with other heavy metal subgenres, nu metal tends to use the same structure of verses, choruses, and bridges as those in pop music.[21][22][23]

Instrumentation in nu metal is heavily syncopated and is based mostly on guitar riffs, with riffs often being inspired by groove metal.[7] Mid-song bridges and a general lack of guitar solos contrasts it with other genres of heavy metal.[7][25] Kory Grow of Revolver wrote, ""... [i]n its efforts to tune down and simplify riffs, nu-metal effectively drove a stake through the heart of the guitar solo"".[26] Another contrast with other heavy metal genres is nu metal's emphasis on rhythm, rather than on complexity or mood, often its rhythm sounds.[10] The wah pedal is occasionally featured in nu metal music.[26]

Nu metal bassists and drummers are often influenced by funk and hip hop, respectively, adding to nu metal's rhythmic nature.[27][28]Blast beats and double bass drumming, which are both common in heavy metal subgenres such as black metal, thrash metal and death metal, are uncommon in nu metal,[22] with deceased Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison being an exception.[29] Nu metal's similarities with many heavy metal subgenres include its use of common time, distorted guitars, and power chords and note structures primarily revolving around Dorian, Aeolian or Phrygian modes.[7] While loud and heavily distorted electric guitars are a core feature of all metal genres, nu metal guitarists took the sounds of ""violence and destruction"" to new levels with their overdriven guitar tone, which music journalists Kitts and Tolinski compared to the ""...sound [of] a Mack truck being crushed by a collapsing skyscraper.""[30]

Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars[31] that are generally down-tuned,[22][32] rather than traditional six-string guitars.[13] Likewise, some bass guitarists use five-string and six-string instruments.[13][33]Bass guitar-playing in nu metal often features an emphasis on funk elements.[31] In nu metal music, DJs are sometimes featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds.[13]Nu metal tends to have hip hop grooves and rhythms.[25][21][31]

Vocal styles used in nu metal music include singing,[21]rapping,[25][34]screaming[22][34] and growling.[34] Vocals in nu metal are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop.[35] While some nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit[36] and Linkin Park,[37][38] have rapping in their music, other nu metal bands, such as Godsmack[39] and Staind,[40] do not.

Nu metal bands occasionally feature hip hop musicians as guests in their songs; Korn's song ""Children of the Korn"" features the rapper Ice Cube, who performed on the band's 1998 Family Values Tour.[41][42] The hip hop musician Nas was featured on Korn's song ""Play Me"", which is on the band's album Take a Look in the Mirror.[43] Limp Bizkit has recorded with multiple hip hop musicians including Method Man,[44]Lil Wayne,[45]Xzibit,[46]Redman,[46]DMX[47] and Snoop Dogg.[48]Linkin Park collaborated with hip hop musician Jay-Z on their 2004 extended play Collision Course.[49]Kid Rock has recorded with hip hop musicians Eminem[50] and Snoop Dogg.[51] Trevor Baker of The Guardian wrote, ""Bands such as Linkin Park, Korn and even the much reviled Limp Bizkit ... did far more to break down the artificial barriers between 'urban music' and rock than any of their more critically acceptable counterparts.""[52]

Lyrics in nu metal songs are often angry or nihilistic;[21][31][34] many of the genre's lyrics focus on topics such as pain,[15][34] angst,[25][34] bullying,[3] emotional issues,[3][31] abandonment,[3][31] betrayal,[3] and personal alienation,[15][34] in a way similar to those of grunge.[3][15][34][53] Many nu metal lyrics that are about these topics tend to be in a very direct tone.[31] However, some nu metal songs have lyrics that are about other topics. P.O.D. has used positive lyrics about promise and hope.[54] The nu metal[55] song ""Bodies"" by Drowning Pool is about moshing.[56]The Michigan Daily wrote about Limp Bizkit's lyrics, writing that the band ""used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs"".[31] Limp Bizkit's lyrics have also been described as misogynistic.[57]Dope's lyrics are usually about sex, drugs, parties, women, violence, and relationships.[58] In contrast, according to Josh Chesler of the Phoenix New Times, the lyrics of Deftones, who were once considered a nu metal band, ""tend to have complex allusions and leave the songs open to many different interpretations.""[59]

Nu metal clothing typically consists of baggy pants,[26][60][61][62] shirts, and shorts,[25][63]JNCO jeans,[64][65]Adidas tracksuits,[65] sports jerseys,[66] baseball caps,[67] baggy hoodies,[62]cargo pants, and sweatpants.[68] Nu metal hairstyles and facial hairstyles include dreadlocks,[68]braids,[69] spiky hair,[60][66] chin beards,[61][68] bald heads,[68][70]goatees,[68]frosted tips,[62] and bleached or dyed hair.[60][68] Common accessories in nu metal fashion include wallet chains,[25][66][70] tattoos,[25][63][70] and piercings,[25][26][63][68] especially facial piercings.[62][70] Nu metal fashion has been compared to hip hop fashion.[26]

Some nu metal bands such as Motograter,[71]Mushroomhead,[72]Mudvayne,[73][74] and Slipknot[70][75] wear masks, jumpsuits, costumes, face paint, corpse paint or body paint. A few nu metal bands, such as Coal Chamber,[76] and Kittie[77] are known for having gothic appearances.

Thrash metal band Anthrax[79] was an influence on nu metal by combining hip hop and rap with heavy metal on their 1987 EP I'm the Man,[80] which laid groundwork for nu metal's development.[67] Nu metal bands often borrowed their heavy metal influence from Pantera, with the pioneering nu metal band Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis said about Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, ""if there was no Dimebag Darrell, there would be no Korn"".[81]

Joel McIver acknowledged Korn as the band that created and pioneered the nu metal genre with its demo Neidermayer's Mind, which was released in 1993.[82][83] McIver also acknowledged Korn as the band that started the new wave of American heavy metal,[82] which is a heavy metal music movement that started in the 1990s.[84][85] The aggressive riffs of Korn, the rapping of Limp Bizkit, and the melodic ballads of Staind created the sonic template for nu metal.[86] The origins of the term ""nu metal"" are often attributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson, who has been called ""The Godfather of Nu Metal"" between producers.[87] Robinson has produced for nu metal bands such as Korn,[88][89] Limp Bizkit[90] and Slipknot.[91][92] Many of the first nu metal bands, such as Korn[93] and Deftones,[94] came from California; however, the genre soon spread across the United States and many bands arose from various states, including Limp Bizkit from Florida,[86] Staind from Massachusetts,[95] and Slipknot from Iowa.[96] In the book Brave Nu World, Tommy Udo wrote about the nu metal band Coal Chamber, ""There's some evidence to suggest that Coal Chamber were the first band to whom the tag 'nu metal' was actually applied, in a live review in Spin magazine.""[97]

In 1994, Korn released their self-titled debut album, which is widely considered the first nu metal album.[98][99][100] Korn had experienced underground popularity at this time; their debut album peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200.[101] In 1995, the band Sugar Ray released its debut studio album Lemonade and Brownies, an album described as both funk metal and nu metal.[102][103] In 1995, Deftones released their debut album Adrenaline. The album peaked at number 23 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on October 5, 1996.[104] Deftones also were temporarily controversial in 1996 when their vocalist Chino Moreno was blamed by TV news reports for a riot that occurred at the 1996 U-Fest festival.[105]Adrenaline was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the summer of 1999. It was also certified platinum by the RIAA in September 2008.[106]

Sepultura's 1996 album Roots features nu metal elements that were considered influential to the genre,[107][108] while Roots itself was influenced by Korn's self-titled debut album.[107][109][110] Nu metal continued to rise in popularity when Korn's 1996 album Life Is Peachy peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200[101][111] and sold 106,000 copies in its first week of release.[112] Attention through MTV and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest was integral to boosting the careers of many nu metal bands, including Limp Bizkit in 1998.[113] Deftones' second album Around the Fur, also released in 1997, peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 on November 15, 1997.[114] The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the summer of 1999, and certified platinum by the RIAA in June 2011.[115]

Few artists were playing nu metal until 1997 when bands such as Sevendust,[116] Coal Chamber,[117] Limp Bizkit,[118] and Papa Roach[119] all released their debut albums, in what Billboard writer William Goodman calls a ""banner year"" for the genre.[120] Limp Bizkit released their debut Three Dollar Bill, Y'all in July 1997.[120] The album's popularity grew in 1999 as the band's mainstream profile began to increase; in March of that year, it went platinum in the United States, and eventually went double platinum in July 2001.[121] Coal Chamber released its self-titled debut album in 1997, which was a minor hit, being certified gold in the United States in 1999.[122] The album was frequently compared to Korn,[123] and Coal Chamber's appearance on Ozzfest in 1996 gave the band attention. Coal Chamber appeared on Ozzfest during the next two years.[124] Also in 1997, Sugar Ray released its second studio album Floored. The album achieved mainstream success quickly and was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA on February 20, 1998.[125] Although Floored is a nu metal album,[126] the only song from the album that achieved chart success was the song ""Fly"",[127] which is instead a reggae-oriented song.[128] Although Sugar Ray continued to be extremely popular,[127] the band abandoned the nu metal genre and became a pop rock band with its 1999 studio album 14:59.[129]

In 1998, nu metal finally began to achieve mainstream success. Billboard cited August 18, 1998, as the ""Biggest Day in Nu-Metal History"", which saw the release of Korn's third album Follow the Leader, Kid Rock's major label debut Devil Without a Cause and Orgy's debut album Candyass.[130]Follow the Leader peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200,[101] was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA,[131] and paved the way for the success of other nu metal bands.[52] At this point, many nu metal bands were signed to major record labels,[4] and were using elements of heavy metal, hip hop, industrial, or grunge.[4] Hip hop artists Vanilla Ice[132][133] and Cypress Hill,[134] along with heavy metal bands Sepultura,[107][108][132] Primus,[135][136] Fear Factory,[132][137] Machine Head,[138][139] and Slayer[140] released albums that draw from the nu metal genre. In 1999, Korn's fourth studio album Issues peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[101][141] The album was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA in one month.[142] The album sold at least 573,000 copies in its first week of release.[141] During the late 1990s and early 2000s, multiple nu metal bands such as Korn,[143][144] Limp Bizkit[145][146] and P.O.D.[147][148] appeared repeatedly on MTV's Total Request Live. As nu metal became popular, it especially appealed to certain groups of young people. Although Limp Bizkit was particularly popular among ""jocks"" and fraternity men due to its hedonistic, hypermasculine lyrics,[149] many other nu metal bands, especially the bands with heavier music, instead appealed particularly to mall goths and outsiders who identified with the genre's typically angsty lyrics.[150][151]

The Woodstock 1999 festival featured multiple nu metal artists and bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sevendust.[152][153][154] During and after Limp Bizkit's performance at the festival, violence occurred and people tore plywood from the walls during the performance of the band's song ""Break Stuff"".[155][156] Several sexual assaults were reported to have happened during the festival;[157] a rape that was reported during Limp Bizkit's performance, and gang rape was reported to have occurred during Korn's set at the festival.[158] Despite the incidents at the festival, Limp Bizkit's popularity and the sales of their then-recent album Significant Other were not affected.[155] The album peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release, topping over one million sold in two weeks,[159] and eventually being certified 7× platinum in 2001.[160]Significant Other sold at least 7,237,123 copies in the United States.[161]

In 1999, Slipknot emerged with an extremely heavy nu metal sound, releasing their self-titled album, which was certified platinum in 2000 and 2× platinum in 2005.[162] In a review of the band's self-titled album, Rick Anderson of AllMusic wrote about Slipknot, ""You thought Limp Bizkit was hard? They're the Osmonds. These guys are something else entirely."" Anderson noted the death metal influence on the album.[163] Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, noted by Anderson for his death metal-influenced drumming,[163] said of Slipknot's music: ""The roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and I could go on and on about all those bands.""[164]

In 1999, Staind's second album Dysfunction was released; the track ""Mudshovel"" peaked at number 10 on the Mainstream Rock chart.[165]Dysfunction was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2000 and 2× platinum in 2004.[166] In 2000, Limp Bizkit's third studio album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album, selling over 1,000,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release—400,000 of which sold on its first day of release, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever and breaking the world record held for seven years by Pearl Jam's Vs.[167]Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water by Limp Bizkit was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.[168] That same year, both Papa Roach's second studio album Infest[169] and Disturbed's debut studio album The Sickness[170] were released. Both albums became multi-platinum hits.[171][172] In 2000,  P.O.D.'s album The Fundamental Elements of Southtown went platinum in the United States[173] and was the 143rd best-selling album of 2000.[174] During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many nu metal bands performed at Ozzfest, including Kittie, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Otep, Static-X, Methods of Mayhem, Taproot and Drowning Pool.[175][176] Ozzfest was successful, with Ozzfest 2000, for example, selling out and having 19,000 audience members.[176] During that same year, nu metal bands like Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit joined rappers like Eminem and Xzibit on Eminem's Anger Management Tour, which had sold-out concerts.[177]

Late in 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album Hybrid Theory, which was the best-selling debut album by any artist of any genre in the 21st century and nu metal's popularity peak.[178] The album was also the best-selling album of 2001.[179][180] Linkin Park earned a Grammy Award for their second single ""Crawling"".[181] Their fourth single, ""In the End"", was released late in 2001 and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 2002.[182][183] In 2001, Linkin Park's album Hybrid Theory sold 4,800,000 copies in the United States, making it the highest-selling album of the year.[179][180] Linkin Park's album Hybrid Theory was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA[184] and sold at least 10,222,000 copies in the United States.[185]

Crazy Town's debut album The Gift of Game peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200,[186] went platinum in February 2001,[187] and sold at least 1,500,000 copies in the United States.[188] Worldwide, the album sold at least 2,500,000 copies.[189] Staind's 2001 album Break the Cycle debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200[165] with at least 716,000 copies sold in its first week of release.[95][190][191]Break the Cycle by Staind was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA,[192] with 4,240,000 copies sold in 2001 in the United States.[180] Although the album featured nu metal tracks, a lot of the album showed Staind moving to a softer sound.[193] Noting Staind's change in style to a softer sound, Tommy Udo of Brave Nu World wrote: ""It's often said that nobody over the age of 24 could possibly like Limp Bizkit or Korn, but Staind are a more mainstream band and their songs are likely to appeal to a much bigger fanbase.""[194]

In August 2001, Slipknot released their album Iowa, which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200[195] and went platinum in October 2001.[196] Critic John Mulvey called the album the ""absolute triumph of nu metal"".[197] P.O.D.'s 2001 album Satellite went triple-platinum[198] and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200.[199] P.O.D.'s popularity continued in the year 2002.[200] On June 5, 2001,[201] Drowning Pool released a nu metal album[202] titled Sinner, which features the song ""Bodies"".[203] The album went platinum on August 23, 2001[201] and its song ""Bodies"" became one of the most frequently played videos on MTV for new bands.[204] ""Bodies"" went to number 6 on the Mainstream Rock chart.[205] In 2001, System of a Down's album Toxicity peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[206] The album was certified 6× platinum in the United States.[207] System of a Down blended nu metal with occasional influences of Middle Eastern music, Greek music, Armenian music, and jazz music,[208] and the band featured political lyrics.[209]

In 2003, MTV wrote that nu metal's mainstream popularity was declining in 2002, citing that Korn's fifth album Untouchables and Papa Roach's third album Lovehatetragedy both sold less than the bands' previous releases.[210] Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis believed music piracy was the reason for the lower amount of sales of Untouchables compared to Follow the Leader and Issues because Untouchables had been leaked to the Internet more than four months before its official release date.[211][212] MTV also wrote that nu metal bands were played less frequently on radio stations and MTV began focusing on other musical genres.[35][210] MTV wrote that Papa Roach's third album Lovehatetragedy has less hip hop elements than the band's previous album Infest[210] and also said that Saliva's 2002 album Back into Your System has less hip hop elements than the band's 2001 album Every Six Seconds.[6] MTV also wrote that Crazy Town's second album Darkhorse had no hit singles and sold less than the band's previous album The Gift of Game.[6] MTV wrote that although Kid Rock's album Cocky had characteristics of the musician's 1998 album Devil Without a Cause, Cocky's song ""Forever"", which featured the style of Kid Rock's nu metal[59] song ""Bawitdaba"", was not as popular as Cocky's country song ""Picture"".[6] MTV also wrote, ""Another cause for nü-metal and rap-rock's slip from the spotlight could be a diluted talent pool caused by so many similar-sounding bands. American Head Charge, Primer 55, Adema, Cold, the Union Underground, Dope, Apartment 26, Hed (Planet Earth) and Skrape—all of whom released albums between 2000 and 2001—left more of a collective impression than individual ones"".[6] Despite what MTV wrote, the RIAA certified Korn's album Untouchables platinum in July 2002,[213] and one of the album's singles, ""Here to Stay"", received a lot of radio play[210] and peaked at number one on MTV's Total Request Live twice.[214]Untouchables sold at least 434,000 copies in first week of release and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200.[215][216] However, Untouchables still did not sell as many copies as Korn's most commercially successful album, Follow the Leader.[65][210] Linkin Park's remix album Reanimation was released in July 2002[217] and sold more than a million copies that year, which MTV described as ""impressive for a remix album"".[200] Additionally, P.O.D.'s popularity continued into 2002 with its 2001 album Satellite. In 2003, Linkin Park's album Meteora peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200[218] and sold at least 810,000 copies in its first week of being released.[219]Meteora by Linkin Park was certified multi-platinum in the United States[220] and sold at least 6,100,000 copies in the United States.[221] Despite the ongoing decline of the genre; several international bands began to experience success with the genre; such as Three Days Grace from Canada, and Lostprophets from Wales. Three Days Grace managed to land a hit single in April 2003 with the song ""I Hate Everything About You"",[222] while Lostprophets managed a hit single in December 2003 with the song ""Last Train Home"";[223] becoming the highest-charting single from a UK-based rock band that year.[224]

Although nu metal's popularity survived into 2002 and 2003, the genre's popularity began to decline sharply by the end of 2003. Despite the success of Meteora by Linkin Park, and Start Something by Lostprophets;[225][226] most of nu metal's mainstream popularity had dropped significantly by the beginning of 2004.[65][227][228] Limp Bizkit's 2003 album Results May Vary, which features a change in sound with many alternative rock songs[229] alongside nu metal songs,[230] peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200,[231] with sales of at least 325,000 copies in its first week of being released. In 2004, Blabbermouth.net reported that, according to Nielsen SoundScan, Results May Vary sold 1,337,356 copies in the United States.[232] However, the album garnered very poor critical reception[233] and consequently performed much weaker than previous Limp Bizkit albums such as Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.[227] Korn's 2003 album Take a Look in the Mirror sold less than previous Korn albums like Issues and Untouchables.[227] By this point in time, indie and garage rock revival bands such as the Strokes,[234]The White Stripes,[235] and Jet[227] were achieving mainstream success as nu metal's popularity started to decline, and by the mid-late 2000s, the popularity of emo exceeded that of nu metal.[15] Also during this time, metalcore, a fusion of extreme metal and hardcore punk, became one of the most popular genres in the new wave of American heavy metal, with the success of bands like Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, God Forbid, Unearth, Trivium, and Bullet for My Valentine. Groove metal band Lamb of God also became successful in the heavy metal genre. Stephen Hill of Louder Sound called the rise of metalcore after the decline of nu metal ""the metalcore revolution"".[236]

By 2004, several nu metal bands had begun to experiment with other genres to adapt to the changes in trends. Linkin Park's third studio album Minutes to Midnight, released in 2007, was noted for its near-complete departure from the band's nu metal sound.[237] Describing the album's style, singer Chester Bennington stated, ""We've really moved away from anything that sounds like nu-metal.""[238] Nu metal bands such as Disturbed,[239][240]Soulfly, Drowning Pool,[202] and Slipknot[241] had begun to utilize heavier elements of groove metal, death metal and thrash metal into their music.[242][243] Similarly to Limp Bizkit; Staind and Papa Roach had also begun experimenting with Alternative Rock into their sound.[244][245] Staind's 2003 album 14 Shades of Grey was significantly less heavy than previous albums[246] and shows the band's departure from nu metal and a movement towards a lighter sound.[247] Papa Roach abandoned the nu metal genre entirely with their 2004 album Getting Away with Murder,[248] moving to a hard rock style.[249][250]System of a Down released two albums in 2005, Mezmerize and Hypnotize. Both did well commercially and critically, but the band took a more alternative metal approach to the two albums compared to their past three efforts.[251] In 2005, Limp Bizkit released an EP called The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) without promoting and advertising the record.[252] The album was not very popular;[253] its sales fell 67% during its second week of release.[254] In 2006, Limp Bizkit went on hiatus.[252] In 2012, vocalist Fred Durst said:

""Here's the deal: say in 2000, there were 35 million people who connected to this band. Twelve years later, lots of those people have moved on. We were a moment in time and it's over.""[255]

During the mid-2010s, there was a discussion within media of a possible nu metal revival because of bands fusing nu metal with other genres.[256] Despite the lack of radio play and popularity, some nu metal bands recaptured some of their former popularity as they released albums in a nu metal style. Many metalcore and deathcore groups[257] gained moderate popularity in the 2010s and used elements from nu metal. This fusion has sometimes been referred to as ""nu metalcore"".[258] Suicide Silence's 2011 album The Black Crown, which features elements of nu metal and deathcore,[259] peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200.[260][261] In 2014, Issues' self-titled debut album peaked at number 9 on the same chart.[262] The album features elements of metalcore, nu metal, pop and R&B.[263] Of Mice & Men's 2014 album Restoring Force, which features elements of nu metal,[264] peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200.[265]Bring Me the Horizon, often described as a metalcore band, released their fifth album That's the Spirit, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200, in 2015.[266] The album draws from multiple genres including nu metal[267][268] and would experiment further with nu metal on their 2020 album Post Human: Survival Horror. The band's keyboardist has described them as a nu metal band.[269]Motionless In White in Graveyard Shift andDisguise features elements of industrial, gothic, metalcore and nu metal.[270]

A nu metal revival began in the mid-2010s with groups like Blood Youth, Cane Hill,[271]Stray From The Path, Sworn In, DangerKids, Islander, [272] and Blind Channel.[273] Within this movement, nu metalcore became increasingly prominent through the popularity of groups like Vein.fm, Loathe and Code Orange. According to PopMatters writer Ethan Stewart, Code Orange's 2017 album Forever led to nu metalcore becoming ""one of the most prominent flavors of contemporary metal"".[271]

While some media outlets believed these artists marked the start of a nu metal revival, Metal Hammer writer Dannii Leivers cited the aforementioned groups as simply hinting towards a revival, instead claiming a revival began in 2021, ""a crop of young revivalists... looking to put a brand-new spin on the music of their formative years"", namely Tetrarch.[274] Other notable acts from this time included Tallah, Orthodox, Vended and Wargasm.[275][276]

Electronic and art pop singer-songwriters incorporated nu metal into their sound in the late 2010s and early 2020s.[277][278][279]Poppy has incorporated nu metal on her albums Am I a Girl?[280] and I Disagree,[281]Grimes on album Miss Anthropocene[282] and Rina Sawayama on Sawayama.[283] The songs ""We Appreciate Power"" and ""Play Destroy"" were pioneering examples.[284][280] Poppy has described this fusion as ""nu-Poppy"" or ""Poppymetal"".[285]I Disagree received critical acclaim for this fusion, with single ""Bloodmoney"" nominated for the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, making her the first female solo artist to be nominated for the award in its history.[286]Dorian Electra incorporated nu metal influences on their album My Agenda,[287] as did Ashnikko on Demidevil, particularly on single ""Cry"".[277][288]The Guardian noted that these mostly female artists have revived nu metal, a mostly male genre, and successfully adapted it to showcase a female perspective. Rina Sawayama said ""metal itself lends itself to toxic masculine tropes, but it's also almost taking the piss out of a very masculine expression of emotion"".[289] Smaller bands have also rose to the scene in the mid-2020s with the genre, including London-based Wargasm, who have been ""validated by the nu-metal daddies,"" after Korn vocalist Jonathon Davis described them as ""his new favourite band.""[290]

Also, several nu metal bands are coming back and releasing new music after decades like Staind,[291]Adema,[292]Alien Ant Farm[293] and Kittie.[294]

In the early 2020s, several media outlets noted that nu metal has undergone a resurgence in interest among Generation Z listeners.[295][296][297][298] In 2023, Google Searches for the term ""nu metal"" were reported as being at their highest in ""nearly 20 years"".[299] Deftones and Slipknot began gaining popularity among Generation Z in the early 2020s when their music was featured in videos on the app
TikTok.[150]

Despite its popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal has often been criticized by many fans of heavy metal music,[52][60] often being labelled with derogatory terms such as ""mallcore"" and ""whinecore"".[21] Gregory Heaney of AllMusic called nu metal ""one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream"".[300] Lucy Jones of NME called nu metal ""the worst genre of all time"".[67] In Metal: The Definitive Guide : Heavy, NWOBH, Progressive, Thrash, Death ... , Garry Sharpe-Young described nu metal as ""a dumbed-down and—thankfully short[-]lived exercise"".[301] When Machine Head moved to the nu metal genre with their album The Burning Red and their vocalist Robb Flynn spiked his hair in the fashion of many nu metal musicians, the band were accused of ""selling out"" and many fans criticized their change of appearance and musical style.[138][302] Machine Head's drummer Dave McClain said, ""Pissing people off isn't a bad thing, you know? For people to be narrow-minded is bad ... [i]t doesn't bother us at all, we know we're going to piss people off with this record, but some people hopefully will actually sit down and listen to the whole record"".[138] Robb Flynn, Machine Head's vocalist, said

There's a minute and a half of rapping on that album. The other 53 minutes of the record are like a giant scar being ripped open while I projectile-vomit through it. If all that people got out of [The Burning Red] was rap-metal, then they didn't fucking listen to it.[138]

Jonathan Davis, the vocalist of Korn, spoke about the criticism of nu metal from heavy metal fans, saying:

There's a lot of closed-minded metal purists that would hate something because it's not true to metal or whatever, but Korn has never been a metal band, dude. We're not a metal band. We've always been looked at as what they called the nu-metal thing. But we've always been the black sheep and we never fitted into that kind of thing so ... We're always ever evolving, and we always piss fans off and we're gaining other fans and it is how it is.[303]

Lamb of God's vocalist Randy Blythe criticized the nu metal genre and spoke about its loss of popularity in 2004, saying: ""Nu-metal sucks, so that's why that's dying off. And I think... people are ready for angrier music. I think people are ready for something that's real, not, you know, 'I did it all for the nookie.'""[304]Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine said he would ""rather have his eyelids pulled out"" than listen to nu metal.[305] Guitarist Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer said that he ""was so glad about"" the decline of nu metal.[306]

Some musicians who influenced nu metal have tried to distance themselves from the subgenre and its bands. Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, tried to distance himself from the subgenre and criticized it,[307] even though he is featured on the song ""Lookaway"" on Sepultura's album Roots, which is often considered a nu metal album.[308] Patton said of his music's influence on nu metal, ""I feel no responsibility for that, it's their mothers' fault, not mine"".[309]Helmet frontman Page Hamilton said, ""It's frustrating that people write [us] off because we're affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating nu-metal and rap metal ... which we sound nothing like"".[310]

Although Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails has said he knows some Korn members and that he thinks they are ""cool guys"",[311] he also criticized nu metal, saying:

When I'm asked what do I think of a lot of the nu-metal bands that are out there, my response is that it seems really insincere to me. 'I've had a really shitty childhood and I'm really upset and I'm really ugly and I've put a lot of make-up on and I'm harder and faster and my voice sounds more like the cookie monster's than yours does'. To me it all comes across as being comical, as being a parody of itself.[312]

In response to reports that Fred Durst, lead singer of Limp Bizkit, is a big fan of Tool, the latter's vocalist Maynard James Keenan said, ""If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, you appreciate the compliment, but you're not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?""[313] While Durst has cited Rage Against the Machine as a major influence,[314][315] Rage Against the Machine's bassist Tim Commerford is open about his hatred of Limp Bizkit, describing them as ""one of the dumbest bands in the history of music"".[316] At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the Best Rock Video category for their song ""Break Stuff"", beating Rage Against the Machine's ""Sleep Now in the Fire"".[315] When Limp Bizkit accepted their award, Commerford went on stage and climbed 20 ft (6 m) up a backdrop, rocking back and forth.[315][317] After the incident, Commerford was arrested and spent a night in jail.[315][316] Commerford said in 2015, ""I do apologize for Limp Bizkit. I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit ... They're gone, though. That's the beautiful thing.""[314][315]

""After Korn's 'Follow the Leader' blew the whole movement into orbit in 1998, nu-metal produced some ridiculous bands, to be sure. And to be fair, plenty of them dwelled in the realms of corny rap-rock and dull alternative radio rock with the occasional heavy riff or tendency to scream, making their designation as 'metal' quite dubious indeed ... [b]ut the movement also produced plenty of heavier bands with primarily metal influences"".

Metal Underground on nu metal's association with heavy metal.[318]

Jody MacGregor of FasterLouder called nu metal ""music's most hated genre""; conversely, he also wrote that nu metal is ""not as bad as people think"", praising several examples of the genre.[319] Although multiple nu metal musicians rejected the nu metal label, Limp Bizkit's vocalist Fred Durst defended it, saying ""Nu metal let people open up and it meant something to people. It really did.""[320]Slipknot's vocalist Corey Taylor, also defended nu metal, saying ""I'd like to think that that whole nu-metal wave was so important to that next wave of American heavy metal, to be honest.""[321]Coal Chamber's vocalist Dez Fafara also defended nu metal. He said he is proud to be associated with the subgenre[17] and that nu metal bands ""broke new musical ground"" saying, ""I think 'hair metal' was cheesy. [But] I think 'nu metal' was different. I think what's beautiful about 'nu metal' is it's different. And you've got so many different influences.""[322]The Smashing Pumpkins vocalist Billy Corgan praised nu metal, saying ""I think it's fantastic. I think the more people are cross-pollinating between different musical styles… it not only has musical implications but it has cultural ones as well.""[323] Sevendust vocalist Lajon Witherspoon, when asked about the 2020s resurgence of the genre, also spoke highly: ""It's funny. I don't mind being in that category because I feel it's awesome that music is resurging and we're not letting a movement get away from us and get so far away that we don't even like it or listen to it anymore.""[324]

Jack Porter of The Michigan Daily defended nu metal, writing

Unfortunately, some barriers prevent listeners from understanding nu-metal bands apart from the identity that genre label has given them—picture a bone-headed suburban white kid sporting a backwards baseball cap. What used to be a descriptor for a specific strain of alternative metal turned into a ghetto for every band that a) plays extremely heavy yet radio-friendly music and b) sucks. Because the genre came to be defined by its lack of quality, many 'serious' music fans have missed out on what it has to offer.[31]

Some nu metal musicians have rejected the label nu metal and have tried to distance themselves from it. Slipknot prefer to distance themselves from other nu metal groups, describing their music as ""metal metal"" and equating their link to nu metal as a coincidence of their time of emergence.[325]

Jonathan Davis had originally rejected the nu metal label, saying ""We're not 'rap rock,' we're not 'nu-metal' ... We might have invented a new genre of heavy music or rock, but I believe the term 'nu-metal' was made up for all the bands that followed us. Those guys to me are nu-metal. And we're just Korn.""[35] In 2014, Davis spoke about the nu metal label, saying:

I've always rejected [Korn's pigeonholing] into some kind of genre that we helped create. It seems like when a band comes out and we do something new and something different, that's all great. When a whole bunch of bands jump on the bandwagon and start copying what that one band did, then it gets called something and those bands are cheap knockoffs of what the original thing was. So, to me, that's why I never liked the 'nu metal' term.[326]

Davis has since become more accepting of the term. In a 2019 interview, he remarked, ""If we invented nu-metal then fuck yeah, cool. It's pretty cool to say we helped invent some kind of movement, that's pretty insane.""[327]

Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis rejected the nu metal label, saying, ""If we get called a 'nu metal' band one more time, I don't even know what I'm going to do!""[40] In 2003, Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, rejected the nu metal label saying ""We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them"".[328] As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, ""As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan [Davis]? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?""[329][330] Davis responded saying, ""Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood.""[330] Moreno also said, ""A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!"".[329]Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying ""We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that.""[331][332]Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he ""never liked or condoned"" the term ""nu metal"" in any way, and said he does not understand ""how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into"" the nu metal genre.[333]Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed ""were ever a nu-metal band to begin with"".[334]

Chester Bennington of Linkin Park initially disliked the band being labeled as nu metal, saying in 2007, ""I know that we kind of helped create, I guess, the sound of that genre, but I hate that genre. I'm not going to speak for everyone, but I can personally tell you that I am not a big fan of almost everybody in that category. There are a few bands that I don't really believe belong in there, and we're one of those bands.""[238] However, by 2012 Bennington said he accepted the nu metal label:

I think for the first time in our history, we're actually OK with being recognized as a nu metal band, especially for what we did early in our careers because the truth is that when we were first doing it, nobody else really was, especially in terms of the hip-hop thing.[335]

In addition to criticizing nu metal, many heavy metal musicians have rejected nu metal as a legitimate subgenre of heavy metal, saying it is not ""true heavy metal"".[318][336] Some nu metal musicians have tried to distance themselves from being heavy metal at all. For example, Korn's Jonathan Davis rejected the ""heavy metal"" label.[303][337][338] When talking with Vice, Davis spoke about Korn being called a heavy metal band, saying, ""I never thought of us to be metal to begin with. Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. That's metal, man. I always thought of us as a funk band. That funky, groovy shit.""[337] Godsmack's vocalist Sully Erna also rejected the ""heavy metal"" label and said he views Godsmack as a hard rock band.[339][340] Linkin Park's vocalist Chester Bennington, though eventually accepting of the nu metal label,[335] had expressed some disagreement with his band being labeled a heavy metal or nu metal group because he felt the term limited the scope of the band's actual style, particularly on their later albums. He elaborated:

[We] wanted to make clear from the very beginning when we were kind of tagged as a 'nu metal' band. Not that we have anything against metal ... [w]e aren't just one thing. So there are elements of the band that are metal, there are elements of the band that are pop, there are elements that are electronic, and hip-hop as well. And we've kind of always felt like we weren't bound to just one genre. So after we made Hybrid Theory and Meteora, we really wanted to take risks beyond what we had already done on those first two records, creatively, and show the world that we can do a lot more than just make nu-metal songs.[341]"

Metalcore is a fusion genre combining elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk, that originated in the late 1980s. Metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to moshing, while other defining instrumentation includes heavy guitar riffs often utilizing percussive pedal tones and double bass drumming. Vocalists in the genre typically perform screaming, more popular bands often combine this with the use of standard singing, usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. However, the death growl is also a popular technique within the genre.

In the late 1980s to early 1990s, pioneering bands such as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, whose hardcore punk-leaning style is sometimes referred to as metallic hardcore,[5] were founded. These pioneering bands took influence from a range of styles and genres such as hardcore punk, thrash metal and death metal. Journalists have dubbed records by the Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch and Coalesce to be milestones in the genre. During the early 2000s, metalcore started to gain more prominence, with several independent metal labels signing metalcore bands. This led to bands such as  Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive all rising to popularity.

Metalcore is known for its use of breakdowns. Metalcore singers typically perform screaming,[6] a vocal technique developed in the 1980s and characteristic of 1990s metalcore. Later metalcore bands often combine this with the use of standard singing, usually during the bridge or chorus of a song.[6] The death growl technique is also popular.

The instrumentation of metalcore includes heavy guitar riffs often utilizing percussive pedal tones, stop-start rhythm guitar,[7] double bass drumming, and breakdowns.[6] Drop guitar tunings are often used. Most bands use tuning ranging between Drop D and A, although lower tunings, as well as 7 and 8 string guitars, are not uncommon. Drummers typically use a lot of double bass technique and general drumming styles across the board. Blast beats are also heard at times. According to author James Giordano, ""tempos in metalcore tend to be slower than those found in thrash metal"".[8] Many later metalcore bands would include guitar solos in songs.

1990s metalcore bands generally had a strong influence from heavy hardcore. In the 2000s, metalcore bands began to be exclusively inspired by heavy metal.[6] Many 2000s metalcore bands were heavily inspired by melodic death metal and used strong elements of melodic death metal in their music.[9] Malcolm Dome of Revolver wrote that without melodic death metal band At the Gates' 1995 album Slaughter of the Soul, ""modern American metalcore (everyone from As I Lay Dying and Killswitch Engage to All That Remains and the Black Dahlia Murder) wouldn't even exist.""[10] Graham Hartmann of Loudwire wrote ""Although metalcore broke in the early 2000s, listening to At the Gates' 1995 album feels like a Nostradamus-esque prediction of how metal would evolve.""[11]

Black Flag[12] and Bad Brains,[13] among the originators of hardcore punk, admired and emulated Black Sabbath. British hardcore punk groups such as Discharge and the Exploited also took inspiration from heavy metal.[14] The Misfits put out the Earth A.D. album, becoming a crucial influence on thrash metal.[15] Nonetheless, punk and metal cultures and music remained fairly separate through the first half of the 1980s. Cross-pollination between metal and hardcore eventually birthed the crossover thrash scene, which gestated at a Berkeley club called Ruthie's, in 1984.[16] The term ""metalcore"" was originally used to refer to these crossover groups.[17]

Hardcore punk groups Corrosion of Conformity,[18]D.R.I. and Suicidal Tendencies[19] played alongside thrash metal groups like Metallica and Slayer. This scene influenced the skinhead wing of New York hardcore, which also began in 1984, and included groups such as Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, Agnostic Front[20] and Warzone.[21] The Cro-Mags were among the most influential of these bands, drawing equally from Bad Brains, Motörhead and Black Sabbath.[22] Cro-Mags also embraced some aspects of straight edge and Krishna consciousness.[23] Another New York metal-influenced straight edge group of this time period is the Crumbsuckers. The year 1985 saw the development of the hardcore breakdown, an amalgamation of Bad Brains' reggae and metal backgrounds,[24] which encouraged moshing. Agnostic Front's 1986 album Cause for Alarm showed a combination of hardcore punk with heavy metal influences.[25]

One of the earliest metalcore scene was that of Cleveland, Ohio. Fronted by Integrity and Ringworm, the sound of bands in the scene was distinctly darker than what the genre would become.[26] Integrity's debut album Those Who Fear Tomorrow  (1991) merged hardcore with apocalyptic lyrics and metal's guitar solos and chugging riffs to create one of the primeval albums in the genre.[27]Revolver magazine writer Elis Enis stated that the album ""influenced practically every breakdown that's been recorded since"".[28] Whereas, Ringworm's debut The Promise (1993) made use of a style closer to crossover thrash while also putting a heavy emphasis on breakdowns.[29] Philadelphia's Starkweather were also an important early metalcore band, with their album Crossbearer (1992) which merged early metal's grooves and dark atmospheres with elements of hardcore.[30]Rorschach also pioneered a distinctly dissoncent and noise-influence niche into this early metalcore sound, which would go on to define noisecore and mathcore.[31][32]

In 1993, Earth Crisis released ""Firestorm"", a song which became one of the most influential in metalcore.[33] The band's militant vegan straight edge ethic and emphasis on chug riffs saw them immediately influence a wave of subsequent bands and gained coverage by major media outlets like CNN, CBS and MTV.[34] The EP the song was a part of was also one of the earliest releases by Victory Records who go on to be a defining part of the metalcore scene in the coming years, through releasing many of the style's most successful albums.[35]

Boston, Massachusetts too developed an early metalcore scene, led by Overcast who formed in 1990.[36] Much of this scene were based around Hydra Head Records, which was founded by Aaron Turner after moving to Boston. Converge were one of the earliest and most prominent groups from the city, formed in 1990.[37] Using Rorschach's music as their sonic template,[38] the band's experimental attitude, emotional lyrics and attention to dynamics led to them becoming one of the most influential bands in the genre.[30] Converge, along with Morris Plains, New Jersey's the Dillinger Escape Plan and Tacoma, Washington's Botch were three of the founding acts in the style's mathcore subgenre,[39] with Kansas City, Missouri's Coalesce and New Brunswick, New Jersey's Deadguy being prominent acts transitioning towards the style.[40] Converge's guitarist Kurt Ballou opened the recording studio GodCity Studio in 1998, and would go on to record many of the most influential  subsequent hardcore records from the city.[37]

New York City's Merauder released their debut album Master Killer in 1996, merging the sounds of metalcore, earlier New York hardcore and the newly emerged beatdown hardcore style. Of the album, Revolver writer Elis Enis stated ""any self-proclaimed 'metallic hardcore' band of the last 25 years is indebted to Master Killer's steel-toed stomp.""[41] Along with All Out War, Darkside NYC and Confusion, Merauder were a part of a wave of bands defining a newer, increasingly metallic style of hardcore in New York that had long been one of the epicentres of the genre.[42] Long Island's Vision of Disorder were also a prevalent band in the scene, being one of the first bands to incorporate clean singing into the genre, which would soon become a staple, as well as incorporating elements of nu metal.[43] In a 2005 article by Billboard magazine, writer Greg Pato stated that ""with seemingly every local teen waving the VOD banner circa the mid/late '90s, it seemed as though it was only a matter of time before VOD would become the band to take 'metalcore' to a massive audience"".[44]

Bridgeport, Connecticut's Hatebreed released their debut album Satisfaction is the Death of Desire in 1997. The album helped the band achieve underground success, selling 158,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan,[45] and holds the record for Victory Record's best selling debut album.[46] The band's style merged classic hardcore with beatdown and metalcore,[47] while also overtly referencing metal bands like Slayer. In a 2015 Metal Hammer article, writer Stephen Hill stated ""The difference between Hatebreed and many of their influences is that where a band like Madball were happy to co-exist with metal bands without feeling like they were part of the same scene, Hatebreed actively went out of their way to become the hardcore band metal fans listen to.""[46] Other influential metalcore bands of the time include  Shai Hulud,[48][49][50]Zao[51] and Disembodied.[52]

Orange County, California metalcore band Eighteen Visions contrasted the metalcore scene's usual hyper masculine aesthetic of ""army and sports clothes"" with ""skinny jeans, eyeliner and hairstyles influenced by Orgy and Unbroken"".[53] This visual style led to the band being called ""fashioncore"".[53][54] Jasamine White-Gluz of Exclaim! wrote that Eighteen Visions look ""more like a boy band than a popular hardcore group. Critics tag the band for putting fashion at the centre of their music, but it adds a playful and interesting touch to a band that sounds much tougher than it looks.""[55] A scene of bands in Orange County including Bleeding Through, Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu continued this in Eighteen Visions' wake,[56][57][58] and influenced emo and scene fashion in the coming decade.[53]

As the decade drew to a close, a wave of metalcore bands began incorporating elements of melodic death metal into their sound. This formed an early version of what would become the melodic metalcore genre, with Shadows Fall's Somber Eyes to the Sky (1997), Undying's This Day All Gods Die (1999), Darkest Hour's The Prophecy Fulfilled (1999), Unearth's Above the Fall of Man (1999), Prayer for Cleansing's Rain in Endless Fall (1999) being some of the style's earliest releases.[59]CMJ writer Anthony Delia also credited Florida's Poison the Well and their first two releases The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation (1999) and Tear from the Red (2002) as ""design[ing] the template for most of"" the melodic metalcore bands to come.[60]

Converge's album was released on 4 September 2001 to universal critical and fan acclaim. The album influenced the development of the sound of other U.S. bands like Norma Jean and Misery Signals as well as international acts like Eden Maine, Johnny Truant and Beecher.[61]
Blake Butler of Allmusic stated that Converge ""put the final sealing blow on their status as a legend in the world of metallic hardcore"" with the album, calling it ""an experience -- an encyclopedic envelopment of so much at once.""[62]Terrorizer Magazine named it their 2001 Album of the Year,[63] and it was named the greatest album of the 2000s by Noisecreep,[64]Sputnikmusic[65] and Decibel.[66]

Douglasville, Georgia's Norma Jean and the Chariot were both influential artists continuing metalcore's earlier sound into the 2000s.[27][67] Norma Jean's O' God, the Aftermath (2005) was Grammy award nominated for Best Recording Package[68] and the Chariot's Long Live (2010) was listed as one of Kerrang!'s ""21 best U.S. metalcore albums of all time"".[27] In contrast to these bands' dark approach to the genre, Buffalo, New York's Every Time I Die incorporated Southern rock elements and humor,[30]Kerrang! noted them as ""shaped the cutting edge of modern metalcore.""[69]

In 2002, Killswitch Engage's Alive or Just Breathing reached number 37 on the Heatseekers Albums chart.[70] In 2004, Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache,[71] Shadows Fall's The War Within,[72][73] and Atreyu's The Curse[74] peaked at numbers 21, 20, and 36 on the Billboard 200, respectively. Also, in 2006, Atreyu's third studio album, A Death-Grip On Yesterday peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200, only to be followed up by 2007's Lead Sails Paper Anchor, which peaked at number 8.[74] Atreyu's 2002 debut album Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, as of 3 July 2004, has sold 107,000 copies in the United States.[75] Killswitch Engage's 2004 album The End of Heartache[76] and 2006 album As Daylight Dies[77] were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Killswitch Engage's 2002 album Alive or Just Breathing, as of 3 July 2004, has sold 114,000 copies in the United States.[75]Unearth began to have success among heavy metal fans in 2004 with the release of their second album The Oncoming Storm, which peaked at number 1 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on 17 July 2004.[78] On that same day, the album peaked at number 105 on the Billboard 200. Unearth's 2006 album III: In the Eyes of Fire peaked at number 35 on the Billboard 200. The band's 2008 album The March peaked at number 45 on the Billboard 200.[79]Oncoming Storm, III: In the Eyes of Fire', and The March peaked at numbers 6, 2 and 3 on the Independent Albums chart, respectively.[80]Avenged Sevenfold's first two albums Sounding the Seventh Trumpet (2001) and Waking the Fallen (2003) were both metalcore albums. On the band's 2005 album City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold moved away from metalcore and changed to a traditional heavy metal sound.[81] On 15 June 2005, Blabbermouth.net reported that Waking the Fallen has sold 172,253 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[82] On 17 July 2009, Waking the Fallen was certified gold by the RIAA.[83]

Trivium also achieved success among heavy metal fans when their 2005 album Ascendancy peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200. Their albums The Crusade (2006) and Shogun (2008) peaked at numbers 25 and 23 on the Billboard 200, respectively.[84] Bleeding Through's 2006 album The Truth peaked at number 1 on the Independent Albums chart on 28 January 2006.[85] On that same day, the album peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200.[86] Metalcore band As I Lay Dying also achieved success among heavy metal fans. The band's 2005 album Shadows Are Security peaked at number 35 on the Billboard 200[87] and sold 263,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[88] As I Lay Dying's 2007 album An Ocean Between Us peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200 in 2007.[87] As of April 2005, As I Lay Dying's 2003 album Frail Words Collapse sold 118,000 copies in the United States.[89] All That Remains achieved success with their 2006 album The Fall of Ideals, which, as of 1 October 2008, sold 175,000 copies in the United States.[90] All That Remains' 2008 album Overcome peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200.[90]Overcome's song ""Two Weeks"" peaked at number 9 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart on 16 May 2009.[91]Bullet for My Valentine's debut album The Poison was released in October 2005 in Europe and was released in February 2006 in the United States. On 26 July 2006, Blabbermouth.net reported that The Poison has sold 72,000 copies in the United States.[92] On 27 October 2007, Blabbermouth.net reported that The Poison has sold 336,000 copies in the United States.[93] On 3 April 2010, Billboard reported that The Poison sold 573,000 copies in the United States.[94]The Poison was certified gold by the RIAA on 30 January 2009.[95] Bullet for My Valentine's second album Scream Aim Fire, released in 2008, peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and sold 360,000 copies in the United States.[94] Bullet for My Valentine's 2010 album Fever peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200, selling 71,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release.[94]Fever's song ""Your Betrayal"" peaked at number 25 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.[96]

As the decade progressed, metalcore became increasingly tied to the social media Myspace, launched in 2003, and the scene subculture that was prominent on the platform.[97] Marketing through Myspace launched the careers of many of the era's most prominent bands including Bring Me the Horizon, Attack Attack!, Black Veil Brides, Bullet for My Valentine, Job For a Cowboy and Suicide Silence. Despite the stylistic distinctness between many of these groups' sounds they became encompassed by the terms ""myspace-core"" and ""scene-core"". Many went on to become fixtures at Warped Tour,[98] and Fearless Records's Punk Goes... cover series.[99]

Deathcore is a fusion of metalcore and death metal.[100][101][102] Deathcore is defined by breakdowns, blast beats and death metal riffs.[103] Bands may also incorporate guitar solos and even riffs that are influenced by metalcore.[100] New York-based death metal group Suffocation is credited as one of the main influences for the emergence of deathcore. Embodyments album ""Embrace The Eternal"" is a foundation for the modern Deathcore sound.[104] Some examples of deathcore bands are Suicide Silence,[105]Whitechapel,[105]Knights of the Abyss,[106]Carnifex[105] and Chelsea Grin.[107]

In 2006 and 2007, a wave of metalcore bands strongly influenced by death metal dubbed deathcore gained moderate popularity. Notable bands that brought the genre to the fore include Bring Me the Horizon and Suicide Silence. Suicide Silence's No Time to Bleed peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart,[108] while their album The Black Crown peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart.[108] After its release, Whitechapel's album This Is Exile sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 118.[109] Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart[110] and also at number 47 on the Billboard 200.[111] Their third album A New Era of Corruption sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart.[112] Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon won the 2006 Kerrang! Awards for Best British Newcomer after they released their 2006 debut record Count Your Blessings.[113] However, Bring Me the Horizon abandoned the deathcore genre after the release of this album.[114] San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album Dead in My Arms, selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring and methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records.[115] Lastly, Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album Hate (2012)[116] making them the first extreme metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.[117]

Electronicore's merger of metalcore with various electronic music styles emerged in the 2000s. One of the earliest contributors to the sound was St Albans band Enter Shikari.[118] Their debut album Take to the Skies peaked at number on the Official UK Album Chart selling 28,000 copies in its first week and was certified Gold in the UK after selling over 100,000 copies. It was also the first album to achieve a significant chart success for a new act operating outside the traditional label system.[119] The group received international radio airplay and a substantial number of musical awards, from Kerrang!, NME, Rock Sound and the BT Digital Music Awards.[120][121][122] Their second album Common Dreads was released in June 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at 16.[123] Columbus, Ohio's Attack Attack! gained significant notoriety with their Enter Shikari-influenced sound. The band's song for ""Stick Stickly"", the lead single from Someday Came Suddenly (2008) went viral online for its use of autotune and synths, with the members' squatting ""crab walk"" stance during the music video giving way to the crabcore meme.[124]Warren, Michigan band I See Stars's debut album 3-D debuted at number 176 on the Billboard 200, number 5 on Top Heatseekers, and number 22 on Top Independent Albums.[125]The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album Dead Throne (which sold 32,400 in its first week)[126] reached number 10[127] on the Billboard 200 chart. Asking Alexandria also achieved success, with their 2009 song ""The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)"" being certified gold by the RIAA.[128] The band's 2011 album Reckless & Relentless peaked at number 9 on the Billboard 200.[129]

Architects and Bring Me the Horizon spearheaded the British metalcore scene of the late 2000s and early 2010s.[130] Architects had begun as a mathcore band on Nightmares (2006) before moving into metalcore by the release of Ruin (2007).[131]Hysteria magazine credited the band's long time vocalist Sam Carter with reviving high pitched screamed vocals in metalcore and ""influencing an entire generation of acts such as Polaris, In Hearts Wake, Void of Vision, Invent Animate, Imminence...the list goes on"", as well as popularising the ""blegh"" adlib, which subsequently became commonplace in the genre.[130] Bring Me the Horizon's third album There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret. (2010), saw the band incorporate electronica, classical music and pop music into their metalcore style,[132] a trend then continued further on Sempiternal (2013), which also embraced elements of nu metal.[133] The Latter peaked at number 3 on the UK albums chart,[134] and was one of the earliest releases by a UK metalcore band on a major label, through RCA Records.[135] Following this, many bands in the metalcore scene began to emulate the sound these albums.[133] The band's massive mainstream success led publications such as the Guardian and the Independent to accredit them as ""the new Metallica"",[136][137] and Metal Hammer writer Stephen Hill to call Sempiternal ""this generation's definitive metal album"".[133]

The nu metal elements present on Sempiternal, as well as Suicide Silence's The Black Crown (2012), led to a wave of bands in the mid-2010s taking influence from nu metal.[138]My Ticket Home's Strangers Only (2013) was a notable precedent of this wave, seeing a previously established metalcore act merge their style with dark, nu metal influence to help establish the coming nu metalcore sound.[139]Issues' merger of nu metal, metalcore and contemporary R&B gained them significant commercial success, with a number of publications crediting them as ushering a new wave of nu metal.[140][141] Their debut self-titled album (2014) peaked at peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart[142] and their second album Headspace (2016) reached number one on the Top Alternative Albums chart.[143]
Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon's fifth album That's the Spirit (2015) saw the band fully embrace nu metal,[144] which peaked at number 2 in both the UK and US.[145][146] In the following years Emmure,[147][148][149]Of Mice & Men,[150][151][152]Sworn In and DangerKids had all embraced the genre,[138] and by 2016, nu metalcore had solidified itself as a movement.[153]

Architect's All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us (2016) was released to critical acclaim, with Metal Hammer writer Stephen Hill called it ""as close to a perfect metal record as one can imagine"". The following year, they released the single ""Doomsday"", their first release since the death of the band's founding guitarist Tom Searle. In the years following the single's release, the song's sound became widely imitated within the metalcore scene,[131] particularly the song's introduction guitar riff.[130]

As the decade drew to a close, a new wave of bands in the genre emerged who harkened back to the metallic hardcore sound of bands from the 1990s. Vein.fm,[154]Code Orange, Knocked Loose, Varials, Jesus Piece, Counterparts and Kublai Khan were all notable groups who gained significant success within the genre at the time.[155] Code Orange saw critical acclaim and success with their Roadrunner Records debut Forever in 2017. Forever's title track was also nominated Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 2018.[156][157][158][159] It too embraced the influence of nu metal and according to PopMatters writer Ethan Stewart, led to nu metalcore becoming ""one of the most prominent flavors of contemporary metal"".[153] Knocked Loose gained significant attention after their song ""Counting Worms"" from their album Laugh Tracks (2016) became a meme due to its ""arf arf"" mosh call.[160] The band's 2019 second album A Different Shade of Blue also received critical and commercial success.[161][162]

Nu metalcore maintained its prominence into the 2020s with Tetrarch and Tallah gaining notability.[163]Loathe's second album I Let It In and It Took Everything (2020) saw critical acclaim, and was consistently praised for expanding the scope of metalcore by incorporating elements of nu metal, shoegaze, emo, post-rock, progressive metal and industrial music.[164][165][166] The band's use of the Fender Bass VI guitar, which tunes to an octave below a standard tuning guitar, became widely sought after following the album's release.[167] Publications credited Spiritbox similarly with Metal Hammer calling them ""post-metalcore"" and ""genre-fluid"".[168] The band's 2020 single ""Holy Roller"" reached the Top 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart,[169] and their debut album Eternal Blue was named the year's best rock or metal album by Loudwire[170] and metalcore album by Metal Hammer.[171]

Around the same time, a number of bands gained prominence in the scene that revived the sound of groups from the mid-to-late-2000s, fronted by Static Dress, SeeYouSpaceCowboy, If I Die First and CrazyEightyEight. This movement grew out of both the hardcore scene and the mainstream success that the emo rap scene gained the late-2010s.[172]

Formed in 2015, Bad Omens' third album The Death of Peace of Mind (2022) was the band's commercial breakthrough after viral success of the album's second single ""Just Pretend"" on TikTok[173] which then topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.[174] By March 2023, the album had received 20 million streams on Spotify, leading to Metal Hammer calling them ""the biggest metalcore band in a generation.""[173] Bring Me the Horizon's Post Human: Survival Horror (2020)[175] and Architects' For Those That Wish to Exist (2021) both also reached number one in the UK album charts.[176]"
"Melodic metalcore","Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of melodic death metal and metalcore; it has a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, distorted guitar tones, palm muting, double bass drumming, blast beats, metalcore-stylized breakdowns, and vocals that range from aggressive screaming and death growls to clean singing. The genre has seen commercial success for employing a more accessible sound at times compared to other forms of extreme music.[2] Many notable melodic metalcore bands have been influenced by At the Gates and In Flames.[3][4]

Melodic metalcore began to take form in the late 1990s and early 2000s, tracing its roots to Swedish melodic death metal groups such as At the Gates and In Flames.[3][4] The stylistic origins of melodic metalcore and traditional metalcore differ greatly. Traditional metalcore evolved out of the hardcore punk scene in the late 1980s, when hardcore bands began to experiment with metal elements such as thrash metal guitar riffs and vocals. In contrast, melodic metalcore most often stemmed from American-based metal bands who began incorporating metalcore elements, such as metallic breakdowns, into their music. Florida's Poison the Well are considered the first melodic metalcore band, proving extremely influential to subsequent bands thanks to their first two albums The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation and Tear from the Red.[5]
Massachusetts' Killswitch Engage are also considered to be a pioneering force in the genre,[6] along with artists such as 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Chimaira, Dead to Fall, Heaven Shall Burn and Unearth.[7][8][9] Of these bands, frequently cited influences include In Flames, Slayer, At the Gates and Pantera.[10][11][12][13][14][15] Belgian groups also played a large part in the development of the genre in its early years, as bands such as Arkangel began embracing the sounds of melodic death metal in their traditional metalcore sound, as early as 1998.[1]

Killswitch Engage released their sophomore album Alive or Just Breathing in 2002, which has been noted as a significant influence on many bands to follow,[16] such as Jinjer, August Burns Red and Miss May I.[17][18][19] By 2004 the genre saw increasing prominence, with Shadows Fall's The War Within debuting at number 20 on the Billboard album chart.[20]Trivium released their sophomore album, Ascendancy, in 2005, which peaked at 75 on the UK Albums Chart, made the band one of the more prominent bands in the scene at that point, despite changing their style away from melodic metalcore on many occasions.[21][22]Killswitch Engage's 2006 effort As Daylight Dies was described by Brandon Tadday of Overdrive Magazine as ""without a doubt one of the most impactful releases for melodic metalcore during the mid-2000s"",[22] peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and spending 22 weeks in the charts, being certified Platinum by the RIAA in 2021.[23] In 2008 the All That Remains' single ""Two Weeks"" peaked at number 9 at the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the U.S., and on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 38.[24] In 2007, the song ""Nothing Left"" by As I Lay Dying was nominated for a Grammy award in the ""Best Metal Performance"" category. An Ocean Between Us (the album that included ""Nothing Left"") itself was a commercial success, debuting at number 8 on the Billboard 200.

Welsh melodic metalcore band Bullet for My Valentine's third album Fever debuted at number 3 selling more than 71,000 copies in its first week in the U.S. and more than 21,000 copies in the UK during 2010 alone.[25] Australian melodic metalcore band Parkway Drive's[26] third album Deep Blue reached number three on the Billboard Rock Charts in 2010,[27] along with Miss May I's album Rise of the Lion having reached number 6 in 2014.[28][29] Melodic metalcore band Bury Tomorrow's fifth studio album Black Flame reached number eleven on the Billboard albums chart in less than a week.[30][31]

Melodic metalcore bands often take influence from the guitar riffs and writing styles of Swedish melodic death metal bands, especially At the Gates, In Flames, Arch Enemy and Soilwork.[2][3][32] Practitioners of the genre tend to make use of instrumental melody, and many prominently feature clean singing alongside typical death metal growls and screams. Melodic metalcore often promotes ""very positive lyrical content.""[33] The genre can also feature harmonic guitar riffs, tremolo picking, double bass drums and metalcore-stylized breakdowns.[34][35] Some bands include guitar solos.[36] Bands such as Trivium, As I Lay Dying and Bullet for My Valentine take a significant influence from thrash metal.[22]"
"Folk punk","Folk punk (known in its early days as rogue folk)[1] is a fusion of folk music and punk rock. It was popularized in the early 1980s by The Pogues in England, and by Violent Femmes in the United States. Folk punk achieved some mainstream success in that decade. In more recent years, its subgenres Celtic punk and Gypsy punk have experienced some commercial success.

Folk punk is related to and/or influenced by various styles such as Celtic punk, gypsy punk, anti-folk, and alternative country. Folk punk is also linked with DIY punk scenes, and bands often perform in house venues in addition to more traditional spaces.[2]

Folk-punk musicians may perform their own compositions in the style of punk rock, but using additional folk instruments, such as mandolins, accordions, banjos, and/or violins.[3] Folk punk possesses a rich history of progressive and leftist political views, involving topics like race, class, feminism, anti-fascism, animal rights, queerness, and anarchism.[2]

The earliest known relationship between punk rock and folk music is that of Woody Guthrie, often known as one of the first punks, who sung songs about anti-fascism and the conditions faced by working-class people in the 1950s and 1960s.[4][5][6][7]

Many proto-punk bands, including the Velvet Underground and T. Rex were influenced by such folk artists as Bob Dylan, Donovan, and the Fugs.

In 1977 London-born singer-songwriter Patrik Fitzgerald released his first EP titled Safety-Pin Stuck in My Heart which was subtitled ""a love song for punk music"". The titular song from the EP still remains Fitzgerald's most famous work and acted as one of the pioneering releases for folk punk by combining punk rock imagery with acoustic guitar and vocals.

Formed in Milwaukee in 1981, Violent Femmes was one of the first and most commercially successful bands to fuse punk and folk, though much of their influence came more from early art rock acts like the Velvet Underground.[8] During the 1980s other punk and hardcore bands would pepper their albums with acoustic tracks or inject folksier sounds, notably the Dead Milkmen, Hüsker Dü, and Articles of Faith. An influential album was the punk-inflected folk-country album released in 1984 when psychedelic hardcore band the Meat Puppets switched their style for their seminal release Meat Puppets II.[9]

In the UK, the fusion of folk and punk was pioneered by the London-based Irish band the Pogues, formed in 1982, whose mixture of original songs and covers of established folk singers, many performed in a punk style, led to three top ten albums in the UK, a number two single in ""Fairytale of New York"" (1987) with Kirsty McColl, and a string of top ten singles and albums in Ireland.[10] The Pogues' lead singer Shane MacGowan had played in London punk outfit the Nips, originally known as the Nipple Erectors.[11]

The pioneers of a more distinctively English brand of folk punk were the Men They Couldn't Hang, founded in 1984. Also important was the Oysterband, who developed from playing English Céilidh music with a fast and harder rock sound from around 1986.[3]The Levellers, founded in 1988, made less use of traditional melodies but more use of acoustic instruments, including violins.[3] Several other prominent members of the English punk scene in the early 1980s were also experimenting with folk influences. Early demos by Chumbawamba feature the accordion and the trumpet, though it would take them over 20 years to transition into a full-fledged folk act. Attila the Stockbroker began entertaining punk audiences accompanied by mandola in 1986, and is still performing. Probably the most successful figure associated with English 1980s folk punk is singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, who enjoyed a series of hits in the 1980s and became a distinct influence on later folk punk acts.[12]

The early nineties saw a general lull of interest in folk-influenced punk, but there were a few acts touring. Formed in 1990, Austin-based experimental bluegrass band Bad Livers is one example, though the band used punk more as a cultural reference point than a musical one, often appearing wearing Misfits shirts and occasionally covering Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"".[13]

1994 saw the creation of Plan-It-X Records.[14] which would later go on to release some of the most quintessential folk punk acts of the late 90s/early 2000s[15] and have a large influence on the genre.[citation needed]

Another genre-defining act, the Moldy Peaches formed in 1994 featuring Adam Green and Kimya Dawson. singing and playing acoustic guitars. The band labeled themselves as Anti-Folk.[16]

Formed in 1995, the World/Inferno Friendship Society is a large ensemble that came to be influential in the later New York Gypsy Punk scene. They combined elements of Cabaret, Punk, and Klezmer into their grandiose and theatrical performances.[17]

At the close of the 1990s, Celtic punk had a revival as bands like Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, Greenland Whalefishers, and the Real McKenzies started to experience a wider commercial notice. This wave of bands, who often mixed Pogues-derived sounds with those of street punk bands like Cockney Rejects, spawned imitators worldwide.[10]

In the early 2000s, a Plan-It-X Records sound, heavily influenced by underground 1990s pop punk and classic DIY ethic began to take shape. For many in the punk community, the record label has become synonymous with folk punk, though they have also released electric acts with little or no folk influence.[14] At the same time in New York a Gypsy Punk sound began to coalesce around Gogol Bordello, Golem, Insomniac Folklore, and other groups. These bands took eastern European instrumentation and fused it with the rhythms of punk, ska, and rock. Many of these bands adopted a very recognizable aesthetic influenced by campy references to Soviet art, burlesque aesthetics, and the classic punk style of the Clash. Gogol Bordello, in particular, achieved a degree of mainstream success.[18]

In the Northeast yet another community was emerging around the band Mischief Brew and Fistolo Records.[19] These acts merged the DIY punk underground with '60s radical folk in the vein of Phil Ochs and contemporary anarchist folk musicians like David Rovics. Notable artists from the Northeast at this time were punk/appalachian hybrids the Can Kickers, and influential singer/songwriter Pat the Bunny under the name Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains. Pat later went on to form Wingnut Dishwashers Union in the late 2000s. He is considered by many to be a highly definitive folk punk artist.[20]

During this period, the genre gained increased attention as Against Me! from Gainesville, Florida achieved mainstream success; however, this coincided with a shift away from their original folk sound.

In the mid-2000s, the west coast began to produce its own DIY scene of folk punk artists with a different sound, connected with Santa Cruz's Blackbird Raum who feature a completely acoustic lineup based entirely around traditional instruments, but with fast punk rhythms and bleak, political lyrics influenced by crust punk. They are closely associated with the all-acoustic hardcore band Hail Seizures and the Northwest Folklife festival folk-punk stage.[21] These west coast bands play acoustically in order to busk.[22] This time also hosted the rise of folk punk created in the Southwest United States. AJJ began in 2004 in Phoenix, AZ drawing inspiration from and collaborating with artists around the country.[23]

In 2004, the Moldy Peaches split up and Kimya Dawson began releasing solo work. In 2007, her music was featured extensively in the soundtrack for the film Juno. This soundtrack went on to win a Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack in 2009.[24]

In 2006, Brian Sella and Mat Uychich formed the Front Bottoms. Their first two albums, I Hate My Friends and My Grandma vs. Pneumonia, as well as their first EP, Brothers Can't Be Friends, featured them as well as Mat's brother, also named Brian.[25]

In 2011, Pat the Bunny and others started Ramshackle Glory in Tucson, Arizona. This turned out to be his last larger collaborative project, as in 2016, revered by many as an integral part of the community, he announced his retirement from folk punk altogether. He cited a dramatic change in his viewpoints, shifting away from anarchism in politics and punk music.[26]

2016 saw also the death of Erik Petersen, member and founder of Mischief Brew, and the subsequent groups disbanding.[27]

One of the most notable disruptions within the community occurred in 2017 when Chris Clavin, founder of Plan-It-X Records and member of several bands including Ghost Mice, was accused of sexual misconduct by several individuals.[28] While he was defended by some close to him, bands he has collaborated with including Kimya Dawson, AJJ, Waxahatchee, Spoonboy, and Ramshackle Glory have condemned his actions, left Plan-It-X Records, and removed their work from future printings of split albums.[28]

The continued rise in popularity of several folk-punk acts during this decade was aided by the emergence and spread of musical videos on websites like YouTube. Some of these videos gained widespread recognition, as exemplified by Days N' Daze's Misanthropic Drunken Loner,[29] reaching well past 5 million views to date. Notably, three channels have emerged over the years, featuring folk punk acts in various formats: A Fistful of Vinyl is a Los Angeles radio show with live sessions every Thursday night on KXLU 88.9 FM. AFoV releases videos of their studio sessions since 2012 periodically on YouTube.[30] Shibby Pictures is a YouTube channel that features mostly indie music videos, short movies and documentaries since about 2010.[31]

The songwriting of Matt Pless's has been compared to that of Bob Dylan.[32] In 2014 Bostonian working-class folk-punker Bryan McPherson got banned by Disney from playing Anaheim's House of Blues, due to his political lyrics.[33]

The Pogues' style of punked-up Irish music spawned and influenced a number of Celtic punk bands, including Nyah Fearties from Scotland, and Australia's Roaring Jack.[34] It has been particularly popular in the US and Canada, where there are large communities descended from Irish and Scottish immigrants. From the US this includes Irish-influenced bands Flogging Molly, the Tossers, Dropkick Murphys, Street Dogs, the Young Dubliners, Black 47, the Killdares, Flatfoot 56, and Jackdaw, and Scottish bands such as Seven Nations. From Canada come the Dreadnoughts,[35]the Real McKenzies and the Mahones; from Australia, the Rumjacks,[36] Roaring Jack and Mutiny; Catgut Mary; from the UK, Neck (featuring a former member of Shane MacGowan's post-Pogues band, the Popes) and Ferocious Dog; from Germany, Fiddler's Green; from the Czech Republic, Pipes And Pints; and from Norway, Greenland Whalefishers. These groups were influenced by American forms of music, and sometimes contained members with no Celtic ancestry and had lyrics sung in English.[37]"
"Celtic punk","Celtic punk is punk rock mixed with traditional Celtic music.

Celtic punk bands often play traditional Irish, Welsh or Scottish folk and political songs, as well as original compositions.[3] Common themes in Celtic punk music include politics, Celtic culture (particularly Gaelic culture) and identity, heritage, religion, drinking and working class pride.

The genre was popularized in the 1980s by the Pogues.

The term Celtic punk is usually used to describe bands who base their music in Irish or Scottish traditional music. It is considered part of the broader folk punk genre, but that term tends to be used for bands that use English, American and other forms of folk music as inspiration.

The typical Celtic punk band includes rock instrumentation as well as traditional instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin, and banjo. Like Celtic rock, Celtic punk is a form of Celtic fusion.[4]

Celtic punk's origins date back to 1960s and 1970s folk rock musicians who played Irish folk music and Celtic rock in the UK, as well as in more traditional Celtic folk bands such as the Dubliners and the Clancy Brothers. The Scottish band the Skids were possibly the first UK punk band to add a strong folk music element, as they did on their 1981 album Joy. Around the same time in London, Shane MacGowan and Spider Stacy began experimenting with a sound that became the Pogues.[3] Their early sets included a mixture of traditional folk songs and original songs written in a traditional style but performed in a punk style.[5] Other early Celtic punk bands included Nyah Fearties, Australia's Roaring Jack and Norway's Greenland Whalefishers.

The 1990s gave rise to a Celtic punk movement in North America, centered around the likes of the Dropkick Murphys of Quincy, Massachusetts, and Chicago's The Tossers - both from cities with particularly large population of Irish Americans - as well as LA's Flogging Molly. North American Celtic punk bands have been influenced by American forms of music. These groups commonly sang in English.[6]"
"Rumba","The term rumba may refer to a variety of unrelated music styles. Originally, ""rumba"" was used as a synonym for ""party"" in northern Cuba, and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as Cuban rumba.[1][2] Since the early 20th century the term has been used in different countries to refer to distinct styles of music and dance, most of which are only tangentially related to the original Cuban rumba, if at all. The vague etymological origin of the term rumba, as well as its interchangeable use with guaracha in settings such as bufo theatre,[3] is largely responsible for such worldwide polysemy of the term. In addition, ""rumba"" was the primary marketing term for Cuban music in North America, as well as West and Central Africa, during much of the 20th century, before the rise of mambo, pachanga and salsa.

""Rumba"" entered the English lexicon in the early 20th century, at least as early as 1919, and by 1935 it was used a verb to denote the ballroom dance.[4] In this sense, the anglicised spelling ""rhumba"" became prevalent and is now recommended to distinguish it from traditional Cuban rumba.[5] Also in the first third of the 20th century, ""rumba"" entered the Spanish flamenco world as a fast-paced palo (style) inspired in the Cuban guaracha, and which gave rise to other forms of urban music now known as ""rumba"". Throughout Latin America, ""rumba"" acquired different connotations, mostly referring to Cubanized, danceable, local styles, such as Colombian rumba criolla (creole rumba). At the same time, ""rumba"" began to be used a catch-all term for Afro-Cuban music in most African countries, later giving rise to re-Africanized Cuban-based styles such as Congolese rumba.[6]

During the second half of the 19th century, several secular dance-oriented music styles were developed by Afro-Cuban workers in the poor neighbourhoods of Havana and Matanzas.[7] These syncretic styles would later be referred to as ""rumba"", a word that also meant ""party"". Traditionally, the three main styles of rumba are yambú, columbia and guaguancó, each of which has a characteristic dance, rhythm and singing. Although still a purely folkloric genre, numerous innovations have been introduced in rumba since the mid 20th century, including new styles such as batá-rumba and guarapachangueo.[7]

In the US, the term ""rhumba"" (anglicised version of rumba) began to be used during the 1920s to refer to ballroom music with Afro-Cuban music themes, particularly in the context of big band music.[5] This music was mostly inspired by son cubano, while being rhythmically and instrumentally unrelated to Cuban rumba.[8] By 1935, with the release of ""The Peanut Vendor"" by Don Azpiazú and the popularity of Xavier Cugat and other Latin artists, the genre had become highly successful and well-defined. The rhumba dance that developed on the East Coast of the United States was based on the bolero-son.[9] The first rumba competition took place in the Savoy Ballroom in 1930.[10] Nowadays, two different styles of ballroom rumba coexist: American style and International style.

From 1935 to the 1950s, the Mexican and American film industry expanded the use of the term rumba as rumbera films became popular.[11] In this context, rumberas were Cuban and Mexican divas, singers and actresses who sang boleros and canciones, but rarely rumbas. Notable rumberas include Rita Montaner, Rosa Carmina, María Antonieta Pons and Ninón Sevilla.[12]

In the 1970s, with the emergence of salsa as a popular music and dance genre in the US, rhythmic elements of Cuban rumba (particularly guaguancó) became prevalent alongside the son.[13] Like salsa, rhumba would then be danced to salsa ensembles instead of big bands. By the end of the 20th century, rhumba was also danced to pop music and jazz bands as seen in TV shows like Dancing with the Stars.[9]

In Spain, the term rumba was introduced in the early 20th century as rumba flamenca, one of the palos (styles) of flamenco. Particularly, it is considered one of the cantes de ida y vuelta, since flamenco itself might have had an influence on Cuban rumba, particularly on its vocal style. However, musicologists agree that rumba flamenca does not truly derive from Cuban rumba, but from guaracha, a fast-paced music style from Havana.[14][15] Apart from rumba flamenca, other syncretic styles of Afro-Cuban origin have been named ""rumba"" throughout the Iberian peninsula, outside of the context of flamenco (where the term cantes de ida y vuelta is mostly restricted), such as the Galician rumba.

In the late 1950s, popular artists such as Peret (El Rey de la Rumba) and El Pescaílla developed an uptempo style that combined elements from rumba flamenca, Spanish gypsy music and pop. This became known as Catalan rumba (rumba catalana).[16] In the 1980s, the style gained international popularity thanks to French ensemble Gipsy Kings.

In the 1990s, the term “tecno-rumba” was used to describe the music of Camela, and later Azúcar Moreno.[17] Since the early 2000s, the term rumba has been used in Spain to refer to derivatives of Catalan rumba with hip hop and rock elements, as recorded by Estopa, Huecco and Melendi.[18]

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, a fusion of bambuco and Afro-Cuban music was developed in Colombia by artists such as Emilio Sierra, Milciades Garavito, and Diógenes Chaves Pinzón, under the name rumba criolla (creole rumba).[19] Rumba criolla is classified into different regional styles such as rumba antioqueña and rumba tolimense.[20]

In the 1930s and 1940s, Afro-Cuban son groups such as Septeto Habanero, Trio Matamoros and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were played over Radio Congo Belge in Léopoldville (Kinshasa), gaining widespread popularity in the country during the following decades.[21][22] Their recordings were also made available to the public as part of the G.V. Series of 10"" singles released by His Master's Voice throughout Africa. Once local bands tried to emulate the sound of Cuban son (incorrectly referred to as ""rumba"" in Africa, despite being unrelated to Cuban rumba), their music became known as Congolese rumba or rumba Lingala. By the late 1960s, Congolese rumba was an established genre in most of Central Africa, and it would also impact the music of West and East Africa under Muziki wa dansi. Franco's OK Jazz and Le Grand Kallé's African Jazz were amongst the most successful Congolese rumba ensembles of the 20th century. A faster subgenre known as soukous (from the French word secouer, ""to shake"") was developed in the late 1960s by bands such as African Fiesta and is often used as a synonym of the former.[21][23][24]"
"Pagode","Pagode (.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}Portuguese pronunciation: [paˈɡɔdʒ(i)]) is a Brazilian style of music that originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a subgenre of Samba. Pagode originally meant a celebration with food, music, dance, and party. In 1978, singer Beth Carvalho was introduced to this music, liked it from the beginning, and recorded tracks by Zeca Pagodinho and others. Over time, pagode has been used by many commercial groups, which have included a version of the music filled with clichés, and there is now a sentiment that the term is a pejorative for ""very commercial pop music"" (see Pagode Romântico).[1]

Original pagode developed at the beginning of the 1980s, with the advent of the band Fundo de Quintal and the introduction of new instruments in the classical samba formation. Pagode lyricism also represented a kind of evolution toward the tradition of malicious and ironic samba lyrics, with a much heavier use of slang and underground terms.

The 4-string banjo, whose introduction is mostly credited to Almir Guineto, has a different and louder sound than the cavaco; that loudness was an advantage in acoustic environments (samba circle), where there are many percussion instruments and people singing along. The 4-string banjo is one of the most characteristic instruments of the pagode sound.

The tan-tan, whose introduction is credited to sereno, is a more dynamic type of surdo, used to keep the main beat of the samba, the ""heart of the samba"", and played with the hands.

The hand-repique, whose introduction is credited to Ubirany, is a percussive instrument used specially for rhythmic turnarounds."
"Dancehall","Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s.[4][5] Initially, dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s.[6][7] In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or ""ragga"") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of Jamaican Patois rather than Jamaican standard English and a focus on the track instrumentals (or ""riddims"").

Dancehall saw initial mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s, and by the 1990s, it became increasingly popular in Jamaican diaspora communities. In the 2000s, dancehall experienced worldwide mainstream success, and by the 2010s, it began to heavily influence the work of established Western artists and producers, which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream.[8][9][10].mw-parser-output .sidebar{width:22em;float:right;clear:right;margin:0.5em 0 1em 1em;background:var(--background-color-neutral-subtle,#f8f9fa);border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em;text-align:center;line-height:1.4em;font-size:88%;border-collapse:collapse;display:table}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .sidebar{display:table!important;float:right!important;margin:0.5em 0 1em 1em!important}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-subgroup{width:100%;margin:0;border-spacing:0}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-left{float:left;clear:left;margin:0.5em 1em 1em 0}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-none{float:none;clear:both;margin:0.5em 1em 1em 0}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-outer-title{padding:0 0.4em 0.2em;font-size:125%;line-height:1.2em;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-top-image{padding:0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-top-caption,.mw-parser-output .sidebar-pretitle-with-top-image,.mw-parser-output .sidebar-caption{padding:0.2em 0.4em 0;line-height:1.2em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-pretitle{padding:0.4em 0.4em 0;line-height:1.2em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-title,.mw-parser-output .sidebar-title-with-pretitle{padding:0.2em 0.8em;font-size:145%;line-height:1.2em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-title-with-pretitle{padding:0.1em 0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-image{padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-heading{padding:0.1em 0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-content{padding:0 0.5em 0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-content-with-subgroup{padding:0.1em 0.4em 0.2em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-above,.mw-parser-output .sidebar-below{padding:0.3em 0.8em;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-collapse .sidebar-above,.mw-parser-output .sidebar-collapse .sidebar-below{border-top:1px solid #aaa;border-bottom:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-navbar{text-align:right;font-size:115%;padding:0 0.4em 0.4em}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-list-title{padding:0 0.4em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6em;font-size:105%}.mw-parser-output .sidebar-list-title-c{padding:0 0.4em;text-align:center;margin:0 3.3em}@media(max-width:720px){body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .sidebar{width:100%!important;clear:both;float:none!important;margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important}}

Dancehall is named after Jamaican dance halls in which popular Jamaican recordings were played by local sound systems.[11] It both refers to the music and dance style.[12] It faced criticism for negatively influencing Jamaican culture and portraying gangster lifestyles in a praiseworthy way.[citation needed]

Dancehall music, also called ragga or dub, style of Jamaican popular music that had its genesis in the political turbulence of the late 1970s and became Jamaica's dominant music in the 1980s and ’90s. It was also originally called Bashment music when Jamaican dancehalls began to gain popularity.[12]

They began in the late 1970s among lower and working-class people from the inner city of Kingston, who were not able to participate in dances uptown.[13] Social and political changes in late-1970s Jamaica, including the change from the socialist government of Michael Manley (People's National Party) to Edward Seaga (Jamaica Labour Party),[7] were reflected in the shift away from the more internationally oriented roots reggae towards a style geared more towards local consumption and in tune with the music that Jamaicans had experienced when sound systems performed live.[14]

Themes of social injustice, repatriation and the Rastafari movement were overtaken by lyrics about dancing, violence and sexuality.[7][14][15] Though the revolutionary spirit was present in Jamaica due to this social upheaval, the radio was very conservative and failed to play the people's music. It was this gap that the sound system was able to fill with music that the average Jamaican was more interested in.[16] Alongside this music was the addition of the fashion, art, and dance that came along with it. This made Dancehall both a genre, and a way of life.[17]

In contrast to roots reggae, which aimed for respectability and international recognition, dancehall did not hesitate in dealing with the day-by-day realities and basal interests of the average Jamaican—especially that of lower classes—and observing society in a provocative, gritty, and often vulgar manner. Since this put spreading via radio out of the question, dancehall initially gained popularity only through live performances in sound systems and specialized record dealing.[18]

Dancehall's violent lyrics, which garnered the genre much criticism since its very inception, stem from the political turbulence and gang violence of late 1970s Jamaica.[17]

In the early days of dancehall, the prerecorded rhythm tracks (bass guitar and drums) or ""dub"" that the deejay would rap or ""toast"" over came from earlier reggae songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Ragga, specifically, refers to modern dancehall, where a deejay particularly toasts over digital (electrical) rhythms.[17]

Sound systems and the development of other musical technology heavily influenced dancehall music. The music needed to ""get where the radio didn't reach"" because Jamaicans often were outside without radios.[19] Yet they eventually found their way into the streets. However, because the audience of dancehall sessions were lower-class people, it was extremely important that they be able to hear music. Sound systems allowed people to listen to music without having to buy a radio. Therefore, the dancehall culture grew as the use of technology and sound systems got better.

The Jamaican dancehall scene was one created out of creativity and a desire for accessibility, and one that is inseparable from sound system culture. The term 'Dancehall', while now typically used in reference to the specific and uniquely Jamaican genre of music, originally referred to a physical location. This location was always an open-air venue from which DJs and later ""Toasters"", a precursor to MCs, could perform their original mixes and songs for their audience via their sound systems.[20] The openness of the venue paired with the innately mobile nature of the sound system, allowed performers to come to the people. Inner city communities were able to gather for fun and celebration. It was all about experiencing a vibrant and trendsetting movement.[21]

Krista Thompson's book Shine further expresses the experience of this trendsetting movement and how particularly women were able to confront gender ideologies to enact change. The use of video light specifically was a way to express  oneself and seek visibility in the social sphere in order to be recognized as citizens in a postcolonial Jamaican society.[22]

At the onset of the dancehall scene, sound systems were the only way that some Jamaican audiences might hear the latest songs from a popular artist. Through time, it transformed to where the purveyors of the sound systems were the artists themselves and they became whom the people came to see along with their own original sounds. With the extreme volume and low bass frequencies of the sound systems local people might very well feel the vibrations of the sounds before they could even hear them, though the sound itself did travel for miles.[23] This visceral sensory pleasure acted as an auditory beacon, redefining musical experience.[24]

Jamaica was one of the first cultures to pioneer the concept of remixing. As a result, production level and sound system quality were critical to Jamaica's budding music industry. Since many locals couldn't afford sound systems in their home, listening to one at a dance party or at a festival was their entry into audible bliss. Stage shows were also an entry for exposing artists to bigger audiences.[17]

Writer Brougtton and Brewster's book Last Night a DJ Saved My Life[25] states that sound systems were a product of Jamaican social lifestyle. The success of music wasn't just in the hands of one person anymore, it was a factor of the DJ, speaking poetic words to the audience, the Selector, harmonizing beats in an aesthetically pleasing way, and the Sound Engineer, wiring the sound systems to handle deeper and louder bass tones. Music became a factor of many elements and the physicality of that sound was a strategic puzzle left for musicians to solve.[16]

At this point the Dancehall genre was still growing in global popularity. InnerCity Promotions Led by Mike Tomlinson And Lois Grant played a very significant role in the development of Jamaica's popular ""DanceHall"" music. Their promotion company through a series of concerts led to the then emerging music from which they labelled, ""DanceHall."" The team started a series called ""Saturday Night Live"" at Harbour View Drive-In. US soul group Gladys Knight & the Pips headlined the initial concert and the showcase also featured boxing presentations from Muhammad Ali. InnerCity Promotions was responsible for establishing and promoting numerous events, their first DanceHall concert was staged in 1984. This was significant because it marked the beginnings of the music's recognition as the ""DanceHall"" genre. Mr. Tomlinson recalls the opposition received from journalist, radio and TV managers at the time, some who refused to run the commercials or play the music to promote the DanceHall series.

The series continued into the early 1990s, the team Mike Tomlinson and Lois Grant played an important role in nurturing and promoting the young talents of the inner city and sound system culture of that era. Through their DanceHall live concerts, many performers found a place to use their voice and make a mark due to the opportunities afforded by InnerCity Promotions.[26] This is from the International Reggae Awards special awarded honors(irawma awards).[26]

Sound systems such as Killimanjaro, Black Scorpio, Silver Hawk, Gemini Disco, Virgo Hi-Fi, Volcano Hi-Power and Aces International soon capitalized on the new sound and introduced a new wave of deejays.[7] The older toasters were overtaken by new stars such as Captain Sinbad, Ranking Joe, Clint Eastwood, Lone Ranger, Josey Wales, Charlie Chaplin, General Echo and Yellowman — a change reflected by the 1981 Junjo Lawes-produced album A Whole New Generation of DJs, although many went back to U-Roy for inspiration.[7][14] He utilized talking over or under a ""riddim"" which is now known as the deejay's seductive chant, part talking and part singing.[27] Deejay records became, for the first time, more important than records featuring singers.[7] Another trend was sound clash albums, featuring rival deejays /or sound systems competing head-to-head for the appreciation of a live audience, with underground sound clash cassettes often documenting the violence that came with such rivalries.[14]

Yellowman, one of the most successful early dancehall artists, became the first Jamaican deejay to be signed to a major American record label, and for a time enjoyed a level of popularity in Jamaica to rival Bob Marley's peak.[7][14] Yellowman often incorporated sexually explicit lyrics into his songs, which became known as ""slackness."" He did this to address his radical opinions on society through sex and politics due to the failed Jamaican experiment of socialism while under Prime Minister Michael Manley.[27]

The early 1980s also saw the emergence of female deejays in dancehall music, such as Lady G, Lady Saw, and Sister Nancy. Other female dancehall stars include artistes like Diana King and in the late 1990s to the 2000s Ce'cile, Spice, Macka Diamond and more.
[14][28]Beenie Man, Bounty Killer, Mad Cobra,[29]Ninjaman, Buju Banton, and Super Cat becoming major DJs in Jamaica.

With a little help from deejay sound, ""sweet sing"" (falsetto voice) singers such as Pinchers, Cocoa Tea, Sanchez, Admiral Tibet, Frankie Paul, Half Pint, Courtney Melody, and Barrington Levy were popular in Jamaica.

Nearing the end of the '80s Jamaican Dancehall artists gained a lot of appeal through their no-nonsense music. This expanded the genre's reach beyond the Land of Wood and Water's borders. The main appeal of Dancehall was the music, and so it gained a lot of popularity overtime. Back in Jamaica hand-made posters were used not just to pull in would-be attendees to parties and dances.[17] This process of making vibrant and colorful posters soon became an icon of the genre. It had helped in providing visual aesthetic of how Dancehalls had taken up the space and grown in the country.

King Jammy's 1985 hit, ""(Under Me) Sleng Teng"" by Wayne Smith, with an entirely-digital rhythm hook took the dancehall reggae world by storm. Many credit this song as being the first digital rhythm in reggae, featuring a rhythm from a digital keyboard. However, The ""Sleng Teng"" rhythm was used in over 200 subsequent recordings. This deejay-led, largely synthesized chanting with musical accompaniment departed from traditional conceptions of Jamaican popular musical entertainment.

Dub poet Mutabaruka said, ""if 1970s reggae was red, green and gold, then in the next decade it was gold chains"". It was far removed from reggae's gentle roots and culture, and there was much debate among purists as to whether it should be considered an extension of reggae.

This shift in style again saw the emergence of a new generation of artists, such as Sean Paul, Capleton, Beenie Man and Shabba Ranks, who became famous ragga stars. A new set of producers also came to prominence: Philip ""Fatis"" Burrell, Dave ""Rude Boy"" Kelly, George Phang, Hugh ""Redman"" James, Donovan Germain, Bobby Digital, Wycliffe ""Steely"" Johnson and Cleveland ""Clevie"" Brown (aka Steely & Clevie) rose to challenge Sly & Robbie's position as Jamaica's leading rhythm section.

The faster tempo and simpler electronic beat of late-1980s and early-1990s dancehall greatly influenced the development of Reggae en Español.

By the early 2000s, Dancehall had gained mainstream popularity in Jamaica, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australasia and Western parts of Europe. There was also a big evolution in sound allowing artists to refine and broaden the genre. This was first seen with artists such as Sean Paul, whose single ""Get Busy"" (2003) became the first dancehall single to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Unlike earlier Dancehall, this new evolution was characterized by structures of music commonly heard in mainstream pop music, such as repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and hooks. Some lyrics were cleaner and featured less sexual content and profanity.

At this point it was a part of the public consciousness. Cross-genre collaborations soon became normalized, with songs such as Beyonce & Sean Paul's 2003 hit ""Baby Boy"" and Beenie Man & Mya's 2000 single ""Girls Dem Sugar."" Alongside this growth many crews were formed by men, women or a mixture of both. These crews created their own dances which developed fame in the Dancehall scene.

Some of the artists who popularised this new era of Dancehall were Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Elephant Man, Shalkal Carty, Popcaan, Vybz Kartel, Konshens, Mr. Vegas, Mavado, Ward 21, Lady Saw and Spice, some of whom saw international success. This success brought forward mainstream appeal toward Dancehall which lead into the genre's modern era.[12]

Dancehall saw a new wave of popularity in Western markets in the mid-late 2010s, with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles, including  Rihanna's ""Work"" (2016) and Drake's ""One Dance"" and ""Controlla"" (2016).[9][10][30][31] Dancehall also reached the attention of many R&B artists who continued to change and evolve the genre.

A variety of western artists have spoken of being inspired by Dancehall music, including Major Lazer, whose commercially successful singles Lean On (2015), Light It Up (2015) and Run Up (2017) all heavily rely upon dancehall music. Several hip-hop and R&B artists have also released material inspired by dancehall music, including Drake, who has cited Vybz Kartel as one of his ""biggest inspirations.""[32][33]

In 2014, Drake took an interest into Popcaan and linked him up with MixPak producer Dre Skull to release his debut album 'Where We Come From'. This saw huge commercial success and went on to receive a UK MOBO award for Best Reggae Album in 2015. The year of 2016 saw Popcaan's rival-artist Alkaline release his debut album 'New Level Unlocked' under DJ Frass Records, which topped the charts in Jamaica, as well as being well received in the US and UK.

Popcaan and Alkaline have always been rival music artists in Jamaica and it is much debated who is the new Dancehall King, since Vybz Kartel was incarcerated in 2011. It has been said that Popcaan's success is largely due to early support from Vybz Kartel(KOTD) and more recent support from Drake.

By 2016, Dancehall had re-emerged into global popularity, artists such as Alkaline, Popcaan, Spice, Aidonia and Rygin King are known as some of the most profound and active artists of this period to date. There have also been prominent global collaborations with dancehall artist such as Beyonce & Shatta Wale's 'Already', Davido & Popcaan on 'Story', and Stefflon Don & French Montana on 'Hurtin' me'.

Since 2017, Dancehall artists from Jamaica have been frequently collaborating with UK acts such as Chip, Stefflon Don and J Hus. This is well in-tune with the boost of urban acts in the UK rising up, and the rebirth of Grime in 2014.[34]

In the late 2010s, a new wave of artists rose to popularity in Jamaica. These artists come from rural parishes, especially Montego Bay, outside of the commercial center of the Jamaican music industry. They are influenced by American trap music, and sometimes refer to lottery scamming in their lyrics. Some of the most popular artists in this style are Chronic Law, Rygin King, and Squash.[35][36][37]

Three major elements of Jamaican dancehall music are the use of digital instruments, particularly the Casio Casiotone MT-40 electronic keyboard, the Oberheim DX drum machine, and the use of riddims, instrumentals to which lyrics are added, resulting in an unusual process of creating songs from separate components. More specifically, many riddims are created using digital instruments like the MT-40, a practice that first became popular in 1985 with the release of 'Under Mi Sleng Teng,' whose success made the accessibility of digitally-composed riddims apparent (Manuel-Marshall, p. 453).[38]

A single riddim can be used in multiple songs, paired with different sets of lyrics, and the inverse is also possible with a single set of lyrics being attached to different riddims.  Riddims and lyric sets are not exclusive to any one artist, and these can be and are spread around with one particular riddim, 'Real Rock,' first recorded in 1967 for a song of the same name, being used in at least 269 songs by 2006 over the course of 39 years.[38] Peter Manuel and Wayne Marshall noted in 2006 that most songs were set to one of about a dozen riddims that were in vogue, with the exceptions being the work of individual, often high-ranked, artists.[38] Recording over riddims forms the basis of dancehall, with modern dancehall layering vocals over ostinatos; the DJs providing the vocals thus, in the words of Manuel and Marshall, carry the song, unlike older dancehall where vocals were interwoven with full songs.[38]

These practices' roots can be described with the concept of families of resemblance as coined by George Lipsitz in 1986 – similarities between other groups' experiences and cultures (Lipsitz, p. 160).[39] Here, the term might describe the links between different artists via shared riddims and lyric sets and through common experiences incorporated into the music.

Donna P. Hope defines dancehall culture as a ""space for the cultural creation and dissemination of symbols and ideologies that reflect the lived realities of its adherents, particularly those from the inner cities of Jamaica.""[40] Dancehall culture actively creates a space for its ""affectors"" (creators of dancehall culture) and its ""affectees"" (consumers of dancehall culture) to take control of their own representation, contest conventional relationships of power, and exercise some level of cultural, social and even political autonomy.

Kingsley Stewart outlines ten of the major cultural imperatives or principles that constitute the dancehall worldview. They are:

Such a drastic change in the popular music of the region generated an equally radical transformation in fashion trends, specifically those of its female faction. In lieu of traditional, modest ""rootsy"" styles, as dictated by Rastafari-inspired gender roles; women began donning flashy, revealing – sometimes X-rated outfits. This transformation is said to coincide with the influx of slack lyrics within dancehall, which objectified women as apparatuses of pleasure. These women would team up with others to form ""modeling posses"", or ""dancehall model"" groups, and informally compete with their rivals.

This newfound materialism and conspicuity was not, however, exclusive to women or manner of dress. Appearance at dance halls was exceedingly important to acceptance by peers and encompassed everything from clothing and jewelry, to the types of vehicles driven, to the sizes of each respective gang or ""crew"", and was equally important to both sexes.

One major theme behind dancehall is that of space. Sonjah Stanley Niaah, in her article ""Mapping Black Atlantic Performance Geographies"", says

Dancehall occupies multiple spatial dimensions (urban, street, police, marginal, gendered, performance, liminal, memorializing, communal), which are revealed through the nature and type of events and venues, and their use and function. Most notable is the way in which dancehall occupies a liminal space between what is celebrated and at the same time denigrated in Jamaica and how it moves from private community to public and commercial enterprise.[42][43]

In Kingston's Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration, she writes:

Dancehall is ultimately a celebration of the disenfranchised selves in postcolonial Jamaica that occupy and creatively sustain that space. Structured by the urban, a space that is limited, limiting, and marginal yet central to communal, even national, identity, dancehall's identity is as contradictory and competitive as it is sacred. Some of Jamaica's significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space, and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing, a memory bank of the old, new, and dynamic bodily movements, spaces, performers, and performance aesthetics of the New World and Jamaica in particular.[44]

These same notions of dancehall as a cultural space are echoed in Norman Stolzoff's Wake the Town and Tell the People. He notes that dancehall is not merely a sphere of passive consumerism, but rather is an alternative sphere of active cultural production that acts as a means through which black lower-class youth articulate and project a distinct identity in local, national, and global contexts. Through dancehall, ghetto youths attempt to deal with the endemic problems of poverty, racism, and violence, and in this sense the dancehall acts as a communication center, a relay station, a site where black lower-class culture attains its deepest expression.[45] Thus, dancehall in Jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the African diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms, such as recorded music, by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society.[46]

In Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall Nadia Ellis explicates the culture of combined homophobia and unabashed queerness within Jamaican dancehall culture. She details the particular importance of the phrase ""out and bad"" to Jamaica when she writes, ""This phrase is of queer hermeneutical possibility in Jamaican dancehall because it registers a dialectic between queer and gay that is never resolved, that relays back and forth, producing an uncertainty about sexual identity and behavior that is usefully maintained in the Jamaican popular cultural context.""[47] In discussion of the possibility of a self identifying homosexual dancer performing to homophobic music she writes, ""In appropriating the culture and working from within its very center, he produces a bodily performance that gains him power. It is the power or mastery, of parody, and of getting away with it.""[47]

Ellis not only examines the intersection of queerness and masculinity within the Jamaican dancehall scene, but suggests that the overt homophobia of certain dancehall music actually creates a space for queer expression. In general, homosexuality and queerness are still stigmatized in dancehalls. In fact, some of the songs used during dancehall sessions contain blatant homophobic lyrics. Ellis argues, however, this explicit, violent rhetoric is what creates a space for queer expression in Jamaica. She describes the phenomenon of all male dance groups that have sprung up within the dancehall scene. These crews dress in matching, tight clothing, often paired with makeup and dyed hair, traditional hallmarks of queerness within Jamaican culture. When they perform together, it is the bodily performance that give the homosexual dancers power.[48]

The popularity of dancehall has spawned dance moves that help to make parties and stage performances more energetic. Dancing is an integral part of bass culture genres. As people felt the music in the crowded dancehall venues, they would do a variety of dances. Eventually, dancehall artists started to create songs that either invented new dances or formalized some moves done by dancehall goers. Many dance moves seen in hip hop videos are actually variations of dancehall dances. Examples of such dances are: ""Like Glue"", ""Bogle"", ""Whine & Dip"", ""Tek Weh Yuhself"", ""Whine Up"", ""Shake It With Shaun"" (a mix of various genres), ""Boosie Bounce"", ""Drive By"", ""Shovel It"", ""To Di World"", ""Dutty Wine"", ""Sweep"", ""Nuh Behavior"", ""Nuh Linga"", ""Skip to My Lou"", ""Gully Creepa"", ""Breakdancing"" ,""Bad Man Forward Bad Man Pull Up"", ""Keeping it Jiggy"", ""Pon Di River"", ""One Drop"", ""Whine & Kotch"", ""Bubbling"", ""Tic Toc"", ""Willie Bounce"", ""Wacky Dip"", ""Screetchie"", ""One Vice"" and ""Daggering"".[49][50][51][52][53]

Dancehall combines elements of materialism and stories of hardships of Kingston, Jamaica.[54] This is seen in the use of gun talk by artists like Buju Banton and Capleton, or the sporting of bling-bling by ""Gangsta Ras"" artists like Mavado and Munga.[55] The term Gangsta Ras, which combines thuggish imagery with Rastafari is according to Rasta critics, an example of how in dancehall, ""the misuse of Rastafari culture has diluted and marginalised the central tenets and creed of the Rastafari philosophy and way of life"".[56]

Kingsley Stewart points out that artists sometimes feel an ""imperative to transcend the normal"", exemplified by artists like Elephant Man and Bounty Killer doing things to stand out, such as putting on a synthetic cartoonish voice or donning pink highlights while constantly re-asserting hypermasculine attributes. Donna P. Hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market capitalism as a dominant feature of life in Jamaica, coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape, where images become of increasing importance in the lives of ordinary Jamaicans who strive for celebrity and superstar status on the stages of dancehall and Jamaican popular culture.[57]

Another point of dissension of dancehall from reggae, and from its non-western roots in Jamaica, is on the focus on materialism. Dancehall has also become popular in regions such as Ghana and Panama. Prominent males in the dancehall scene are expected to dress in very expensive casual wear, indicative of European urban styling and high fashion that suggest wealth and status.[58] Since the late 1990s, males in the dancehall culture have rivalled their female counterparts to look fashioned and styled.[59] The female dancehall divas are all scantily clad, or dressed in spandex outfits that accentuate more than cover the shape of the body. In the documentary It's All About Dancing, prominent dancehall artist Beenie Man argues that one could be the best DJ or the smoothest dancer, but if one wears clothing that reflects the economic realities of the majority of the partygoers, one will be ignored, and later Beenie Man returned to perform as Ras Moses.[60]

According to Carolyn Cooper in Sound Clash, written in 2004, dancehall music and its following were frequently attacked for frequent references to guns and violence in lyrics, with Cooper responding by arguing that the emergence of firearms was less a sign of genuinely violent undercurrents in dancehall and more a theatrical adoption of the role of guns as tools of power. That ties into the concepts of the badman, a defiant, rebellious figure who often use a gun to maintain a level of respect and fear.  Said concepts, Cooper argues, originate in historical resistance to slavery and emulation of imported films, specifically North American action films with gun-wielding protagonists.[61]

Adding to the concept of gunfire as theatrical element is the use of gunfire as a way to show support for a performing DJ or singer, which eventually gave way to flashing cigarette lighters, displaying glowing cellphone monitors, and igniting aerosol sprays.[61] Gunfire as a form of cheering has extended beyond dancehall culture with the phrase ""pram, pram!"" becoming a general expression of approval or support.[61]

However, Cooper's assessment of the presence of guns in Jamaican dancehall is not wholly uncritical, with a discussion of Buju Banton's 'Mr. Nine' interpreting the song as a denouncement of what Cooper describes as gun culture gone out of control.[61]

Part of the criticism of Jamaican dancehall appears to be the product of cultural clash stemming from a lack of insider knowledge on the nuances of the music's content and the culture surrounding said music.  This struggle is something ethnomusicologists struggle with, even within an academic setting, with Bruno Nettl describing in The Study of Ethnomusicology how ""insider"" and ""outsider"" viewpoints would reveal different understandings on the same music.[62] Indeed, Nettl later mentions growing questions of who ethnomusicological studies benefited, especially from the groups being studied.  And even then, in May It Fill Your Soul, Timothy Rice mentioned that even insider scholars required a level of distanciation to scrutinize their own cultures as needed.[63]

After the popularizing of Buju Banton's dancehall song ""Boom Bye Bye"" in the early 1990s, dancehall music came under criticism from international organizations and individuals over anti-gay lyrics.[64][65][66] In some cases, dancehall artists whose music featured anti-gay lyrics have had their concerts cancelled.[67][68] Various singers were investigated by international law enforcement agencies such as Scotland Yard, on the grounds that the lyrics incited the audience to assault gay people. For example, Buju Banton's 1993 hit ""Boom Bye Bye"" advocates the violent assaults and murders of gay people. Another example, T.O.K.'s song ""Chi Chi Man"" which advocates the killing of gay men and women.

Some of the affected singers believed that legal or commercial sanctions were an attack against freedom of speech and were affected by anti-Black attitudes in the music industry internationally.[69]  Many artists have over time apologized for their mistreatment of LGBTQ+ communities, particularly in Jamaica, and agreed to not use anti-gay lyrics nor continue to perform or profit off their previously anti-gay music.[70]  ""Stop Murder Music"" is/was a movement against homophobia in dancehall music. This movement actively targeted homophobia in dancehall music and was partially initiated by a controversial UK based group OutRage! and supported by the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group (UK based) and J-Flag (Jamaica based). It led to some dancehall artists signing the Reggae Compassionate Act.[70] Dancehall artist Mista Majah P has created dancehall music more recently that celebrates and advocates for LGBTQ+ people.[71][72]

Some artists agreed not to use anti-gay lyrics during their concerts in certain countries internationally because their concerts kept being protested and cancelled.[73][74] However, this fails to address the most serious effects of the anti-gay lyrics in dancehall music which are on the LGBTQ+ people of Jamaica, where this music is most present.

The global treatment of dancehall can often represent the continued anti-Black association of homophobia with Blackness.[75] For example, dancehall artists that have not used anti-gay lyrics and even write music advocating for gay rights have been excluded internationally from certain spaces because it is assumed they are homophobic.[72] Additionally, groups internationally have acted as though the gay-rights criticism of homophobic dancehall songs or artists is not important to Black communities.[75] This represents the anti-Black and anti-gay attitude that work to erase intersectional Black LGBTQ+ identities.[75] In fact, many LGBTQ+ Black people, particularly with connections to Jamaica, continue to experience the complexities of dancehall music, both culturally important and at times deeply violent. This is demonstrated in the film ""Out and Bad: London's LGBT Dancehall Scene"" which discusses the experience of a group of LGBTQ+ Black, and mostly Jamaican, people in London.[76] Dancehall is important to their culture, both in connection with Jamaican heritage and in how social interactions are constructed around dance and music. However, it is discussed how many dancehall songs contain homophobic and transphobic lyrics.[76] One interviewee comments ""We still enjoy ourselves to these kinds of music because [what matters to us is] the rhythm of the music, the beat, the way the music makes us feel.""[76]

Scholars have theorized around the significance and meaning around the use of anti-gay lyrics in dancehall music. Donna P. Hope argues that dancehall culture's anti-gay lyrics formed part of a macho discussion that advanced the interest of the heterosexual male in Jamaica, which is a Christian society with strong Rastafari movement influence as well. Dancehall culture in Jamaica often included imagery of men dressing and dancing in a way stereotypically associated with gay-male style.[77] However, the cultural, religious, and social gender-norms continued to advance the ideal man as macho and heterosexual, any divergence from this would be identified as inadequate and impure portraits of true masculinity.[78][77]

Some authors have suggested that this duality, the presentation of ""queerness,"" in dance style and dress, and the violent homophobia, in dancehall spaces can be explained by the ritualistic ""doing away with 'homosexuality'.""[79] Scholar Nadia Ellis suggests that when songs with homophobic lyrics are played, the environment of dancehall spaces can become serious and individuals can use the opportunity to reinstate their allegiance to heteronormativity.[79] These songs thus act to ""consecrate"" the spaces as straight and masculine. In the safety this ritualized hetero-normativity creates, the space may be opened to more free expression and participants can then more openly engage with styles and dancing that might have been seen as queer.[79] Ellis writes: ""The songs are played; no one is 'gay'; everyone can turn a blind eye.""[79]

The  backlash to Banton's violently anti-gay ""Boom Bye-Bye"", and the reality of Kingston's violence which saw the deaths of deejays Pan Head and Dirtsman saw another shift, this time back towards Rastafari and cultural themes, with several of the hardcore slack ragga artists finding religion, and the ""conscious ragga"" scene becoming an increasingly popular movement. A new generation of singers and deejays emerged that harked back to the roots reggae era, notably Garnett Silk, Tony Rebel, Sanchez, Luciano, Anthony B and Sizzla. Some popular deejays, most prominently Buju Banton and Capleton, began to cite Rastafari and turn their lyrics and music in a more conscious, rootsy direction. Many modern dancehall Rasta artists identify with Bobo Ashanti.

Dancehalls are used to communicate messages of women's power and control in a protest against their gendered experience embedded in Jamaican culture. Danger, a dancehall queen and the winner of the International Dancehall Queen Competition in 2014, expresses her power through dancehalls as she explains: ""We are queens, we are not afraid to go out there to do what we want to, demand what we want, and to live how we want, and represent women all over the world and to let them know it is okay to be yourself and that it is ok to not hold back"" [80] Raquel, also known as Dancing Princess, describes her ability to communicate through the dancehall: ""What you've lived, what you feel, put it in the dance. That's what dance is, expressing with your body what you feel and who you are. (...) dancehall is the way of the woman to say no, I am a woman respect me.""[81] As evidenced by these women, dancehall is a space that allows for women to be empowered and to communicate their liberation from the boundaries imposed on them. Rather by negotiating their own boundaries in the dancehall, by taking control of their bodies, and by communicating their power, they are demanding respect when confronted by those who do not believe they deserve it."
"Reggae","Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora.[1] A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, ""Do the Reggay"", was the first popular song to use the word reggae, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.[2][3] While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as by American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady.[4] Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary.[5] It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.[6]

Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting pan-Africanism.[7][8][9] Soon after the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafari and spread its gospel throughout the world.[8] Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of Rastafari. The musician becomes the messenger, and as Rastafari see it, ""the soldier and the musician are tools for change.""[10]

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing),[11]calypso,[12] and also draws influence from traditional African folk rhythms. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower-paced than both ska and rocksteady.[13] The concept of call and response can be found throughout reggae music. The genre of reggae music is led by the drum and bass.[14][15] Some key players in this sound are Jackie Jackson from Toots and the Maytals,[16]Carlton Barrett from Bob Marley and the Wailers,[17]Lloyd Brevett from the Skatalites,[18]Paul Douglas from Toots and the Maytals,[19]Lloyd Knibb from the Skatalites,[20]Winston Grennan,[21]Sly Dunbar,[22] and Anthony ""Benbow"" Creary from the Upsetters.[23] The bass guitar often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and equalized so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The guitar in reggae usually plays on the offbeat of the rhythm.  It is common for reggae to be sung in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican English, and Iyaric dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics,[24] although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing.

Reggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. Reggae en Español spread from the Spanish-speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American countries of Venezuela and Guyana then to the rest of South America. Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe in 1980.

The 1967 edition of the Dictionary of Jamaican English lists reggae as ""a recently estab. sp. for rege"", as in rege-rege, a word that can mean either ""rags, ragged clothing"" or ""a quarrel, a row"".[25]Reggae as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit ""Do the Reggay"" by the Maytals which named the genre.

Reggae historian Steve Barrow credits Clancy Eccles with altering the Jamaican patois word  streggae (loose woman) into reggae.[26] However, Toots Hibbert said:

There's a word we used to use in Jamaica called ""streggae"". If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say ""Man, she's streggae"" it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, ""OK man, let's do the reggay."" It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing ""Do the reggay, do the reggay"" and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.[27]

Bob Marley said that the word reggae came from a Spanish term for ""the king's music"".[28] The liner notes of To the King, a compilation of Christian gospel reggae, suggest that the word reggae was derived from the Latin regi meaning 'to the king'.[29]

Reggae's direct origins are in the ska and rocksteady of 1960s Jamaica, strongly influenced by traditional Caribbean mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska was originally a generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967 and emerged from Jamaican R&B, which was based largely on American R&B and doo-wop.[30] Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more stamped by its origins in reggae music and social milieu.[31] The Rastafari movement was a significant influence on reggae, with Rasta drummers like Count Ossie taking part in seminal recordings.[32] One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the Nyabinghi rhythm, a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in the Rastafarian life.[33]

In the latter half of the 20th century, phonograph records became of central importance to the Jamaican music industry, playing a significant cultural and economic role in the development of reggae music.[34] ""In the early 1950s, Jamaican entrepreneurs began issuing 78s""[34] but this format would soon be superseded by the 7"" single, first released in 1949.[35] In 1951 the first recordings of mento music were released as singles and showcased two styles of mento: an acoustic rural style, and a jazzy pop style.[36] Other 7"" singles to appear in Jamaica around this time were covers of popular American R&B hits, made by Kingston sound system operators to be played at public dances.[34] Meanwhile, Jamaican expatriates started issuing 45s on small independent labels in the United Kingdom, many mastered directly from Jamaican 45s.[34]

Ska arose in Jamaican studios in the late 1950s, developing from this mix of American R&B, mento and calypso music.[26] Notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs, ska is characterized by a quarter note walking bass line, guitar and piano offbeats, and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats. When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, ska became the music of choice for young Jamaicans seeking music that was their own. Ska also became popular among mods in Britain.

In the mid-1960s, ska gave rise to rocksteady, a genre slower than ska featuring more romantic lyrics and less prominent horns.[37] Theories abound as to why Jamaican musicians slowed the ska tempo to create rocksteady; one is that the singer Hopeton Lewis was unable to sing his hit song ""Take It Easy"" at a ska tempo.[26] The name ""rocksteady"" was codified after the release of a single by Alton Ellis. Many rocksteady rhythms later were used as the basis of reggae recordings, whose slower tempos allowed for the ""double skank"" guitar strokes on the offbeat.

Reggae developed from ska and rocksteady in the late 1960s. Larry And Alvin's ""Nanny Goat"" and the Beltones' ""No More Heartaches"" were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae's great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry's ""People Funny Boy"", to the uptown sounds of Third World's ""Now That We've Found Love"", it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae.[38]  The shift from rocksteady to reggae was illustrated by the organ shuffle pioneered by Jamaican musicians like Jackie Mittoo and Winston Wright and featured in transitional singles ""Say What You're Saying"" (1968) by Eric ""Monty"" Morris and ""People Funny Boy"" (1968) by Lee ""Scratch"" Perry.[citation needed]

Early 1968 was when the first bona fide reggae records were released: ""Nanny Goat"" by Larry Marshall and ""No More Heartaches"" by the Beltones. That same year, the newest Jamaican sound began to spawn big-name imitators in other countries. American artist Johnny Nash's 1968 hit ""Hold Me Tight"" has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. Around the same time, reggae influences were starting to surface in rock and pop music; one example is 1968's ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" by the Beatles.[39]

The Wailers, a band started by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer in 1963, is perhaps the most recognized band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Over a dozen Wailers songs are based on or use a line from Jamaican mento songs. Other significant ska artists who made the leap to reggae include Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker, Ken Boothe, and Millie Small, best known for her 1964 blue-beat/ska cover version of ""My Boy Lollipop"" which was a smash hit internationally.[40]

Notable Jamaican producers influential in the development of ska into rocksteady and reggae include: Coxsone Dodd, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Leslie Kong, Duke Reid, Joe Gibbs and King Tubby. Chris Blackwell, who founded Island Records in Jamaica in 1960,[41] relocated to England in 1962, where he continued to promote Jamaican music. He formed a partnership with Lee Gopthal's Trojan Records in 1968, which released reggae in the UK until bought by Saga records in 1974.

Reggae's influence bubbled to the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts in late 1972. First Three Dog Night hit No. 1 in September with a cover of the Maytones' version of ""Black and White"". Then Johnny Nash was at No. 1 for four weeks in November with ""I Can See Clearly Now"". Paul Simon's single ""Mother And Child Reunion"" – a track which he recorded in Kingston, Jamaica with Jimmy Cliff's backing group – was ranked by Billboard as the No. 57 song of 1972.

In 1973, the film The Harder They Come starring Jimmy Cliff was released and introduced Jamaican music to cinema audiences outside Jamaica.[42] Though the film achieved cult status, its limited appeal meant that it had a smaller impact than Eric Clapton's 1974 cover of Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" which made it onto the playlists of mainstream rock and pop radio stations worldwide. Clapton's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" used modern rock production and recording techniques and faithfully retained most of the original reggae elements; it was a breakthrough pastiche devoid of any parody and played an important part in bringing the music of Bob Marley to a wider rock audience.[26] By the mid-1970s, authentic reggae dub plates and specials were getting some exposure in the UK on John Peel's radio show, who promoted the genre for the rest of his career.[43] Around the same time, British filmmaker Jeremy Marre documented the Jamaican music scene in Roots Rock Reggae, capturing the heyday of Roots reggae.[44]

While the quality of Reggae records produced in Jamaica took a turn for the worse following the oil crisis of the 1970s, reggae produced elsewhere began to flourish.[45][34] In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK punk rock scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ Don Letts would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as The Roxy. Punk bands such as the Clash, the Ruts, the Members and the Slits played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad and UB40, as well as artists such as Smiley Culture and Carroll Thompson. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK inner city themes, and Jamaican patois became intermingled with Cockney slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of lovers rock, was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as Gregory Isaacs, the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and Janet Kay. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott. The Grammy Awards introduced the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album category in 1985.

Women also play a role in the reggae music industry personnel such as Olivia Grange, president of Specs-Shang Musik; Trish Farrell, president of Island/Jamaica; Lisa Cortes, president of Loose Cannon; Jamaican-American Sharon Gordon, who has worked in the independent reggae music industry.[46]

Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding made February 2008 the first annual Reggae Month in Jamaica. To celebrate, the Recording Industry Association of Jamaica (RIAJam) held its first Reggae Academy Awards on 24 February 2008. In addition, Reggae Month included a six-day Global Reggae conference, a reggae film festival, two radio station award functions, and a concert tribute to the late Dennis Brown, who Bob Marley cited as his favorite singer. On the business side, RIAJam held events focused on reggae's employment opportunities and potential international revenue. .[47] Reggae Month 2019 in Jamaica was welcomed with multiple events ranging from corporate reggae functions to major celebrations in honour of Bob Marley's Birthday on 6 February to a tribute concert in honour of Dennis Brown on 24 February along with a sold-out concert by 2019 Reggae Grammy nominated artiste Protoje for his A Matter of Time Live held at Hope Gardens in Kingston on 23 February.

In November 2018 ""reggae music of Jamaica"" was added to the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity the decision recognised reggae's ""contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual.""[48]

The term cod reggae is popularly used to describe reggae done by non-Caribbean people, often in a disparaging manner because of perceived inauthenticity. Boy George has been described as “one of the great cod reggae artists of all time.”[49]

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues (R&B), jazz, mento, calypso, African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead—drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple of vocalists.[51]

Reggae is played in 44 time because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as 34. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the skank.[52]

This rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each bar and combines with the drum's emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an ""and"" (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ... , etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the ""downbeat"".[53]

The tempo of reggae is usually slower than both ska and rocksteady.[13] It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of syncopated, melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.

Reggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.[54]

The guitar in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in 44 time and counting ""1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ..."", one would play a downstroke on the ""and"" part of the beat.[55] A musical figure known as skank or the 'bang"" has a very dampened, short and scratchy chop sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to ""Stir It Up"" by the Wailers. Artist and producer Derrick Harriott says, ""What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.""[56]

The reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.[57]

Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered Motown or Atlantic soul and funk songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing materialism, or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as apartheid. Many reggae songs promote the use of cannabis (also known as herb, ganja, or sinsemilla), considered a sacrament in the Rastafari movement. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music – whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God (Jah). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include black nationalism, anti-racism, anti-colonialism,[58]anti-capitalism and criticism of political systems and ""Babylon"".

In recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as ""Give a Little Love"", ""One Love"", or ""Three Little Birds"", all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.[59]

Some dancehall and ragga artists have been criticised for homophobia,[60] including threats of violence.[61]Buju Banton's song ""Boom Bye-Bye"" states that gays ""haffi dead"" (have to die). Other notable dancehall artists who have been accused of homophobia include Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man. The controversy surrounding anti-gay lyrics has led to the cancellation of UK tours by Beenie Man and Sizzla. Toronto, Canada has also seen the cancellation of concerts due to artists such as Elephant Man and Sizzla refusing to conform to similar censorship pressures.[62][63]

After lobbying from the Stop Murder Music coalition, the dancehall music industry agreed in 2005 to stop releasing songs that promote hatred and violence against gay people.[64][65] In June 2007, Beenie Man, Sizzla and Capleton signed up to the Reggae Compassionate Act, in a deal brokered with top dancehall promoters and Stop Murder Music activists. They renounced homophobia and agreed to ""not make statements or perform songs that incite hatred or violence against anyone from any community"". Five artists targeted by the anti-homophobia campaign did not sign up to the act, including Elephant Man, TOK, Bounty Killa and Vybz Kartel.[66] Buju Banton and Beenie Man both gained positive press coverage around the world for publicly renouncing homophobia by signing the Reggae Compassion Act. However, both of these artists have since denied any involvement in anti-homophobia work and both deny having signed any such act.[67]

Reggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres.[68] In November 2018 UNESCO added the ""reggae music of Jamaica"" to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.[48][69]

Reggae en Español spread from mainland South American Caribbean from Venezuela and Guyana to the rest of South America.  It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. Samba reggae originated in Brazil as a blend of samba with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in Veracruz, Mexico. The most notable Jarocho reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from Xalapa. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band Gondwana, and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band Cultura Profética is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.[70]

Brazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the civil rights movement and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafari. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.[71]

Musically, it was the bloco afro Olodum and its lead percussionist, Neguinho do Samba, that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new toques (drumming patterns) were labeled ""samba-reggae"" and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.

In the state of Maranhão, in northeastern Brazil, reggae is a very popular genre. São Luís, the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 radiolas, the name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers stacked. Reggae in Maranhão has its own characteristics, such as melody and dance style, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the Reggae Museum of Maranhão was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after Jamaica), with the objective of preserving the state's reggae cultural history.[72]

In the United States, bands like Rebelution, Slightly Stoopid, Stick Figure, and SOJA are considered progressive reggae bands sometimes referred to as Cali Reggae or Pacific Dub. The American reggae scene is heavily centred in Southern California, with large scenes also in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Miami, and Honolulu. For decades, Hawaiian reggae has had a big following on the Hawaiian islands and the West coast of the US.[73] On the east coast upstate NY has seen a rise in original roots reggae bands such as Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad and John Brown's Body who were inspired by Jamaican reggae bands that performed in the area in the 1980s and 1990s.[74]Matisyahu gained prominence by blending traditional Jewish themes with reggae.[75] Compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish. There is a large Caribbean presence in Toronto and Montreal, Canada, with English and French influences on the reggae genre.[clarification needed][citation needed] Canadian band Magic!'s 2013 single ""Rude"" was an international hit.

In 2017, Toots and the Maytals became the second reggae-based group to ever perform at the Coachella festival, after Chronixx in 2016.[76][77][78]

The UK was a primary destination for Caribbean people looking to emigrate as early as the 1950s. Because of this, Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is lovers rock, but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like drum and bass and dubstep. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Maxi Priest began his career with seminal British sound system Saxon Studio International.

Three reggae-tinged singles from the Police's 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the 1970s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials' leader and keyboardist, Jerry Dammers, founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.[79]

Birmingham based reggae/pop music band UB40 were main contributors to the British reggae scene throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The achieved international success with hits such as ""Red Red Wine"", ""Kingston Town"" and ""(I Can't Help) Falling in Love with You.""

Other UK-based artists that had international impact include Aswad, Misty in Roots, Steel Pulse, Janet Kay, Tippa Irie, Smiley Culture and more recently Bitty McLean. There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be Alborosie (Italy) and Gentleman (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many riddims. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous Tuff Gong Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, Gaudi, Reggae National Tickets, Sud Sound System, Pitura Freska and B.R. Stylers.

Reggae appeared on the Yugoslav popular music scene in the late 1970s, through sporadic songs by various rock acts, most prominently by new wave bands Haustor, Šarlo Akrobata, Aerodrom, Laboratorija Zvuka, Piloti, Zana, Du Du A and Grupa I. In the mid-1980s appeared Del Arno Band, often considered the first Yugoslav band whose sound was primarily reggae-oriented, remaining one of the most notable reggae acts on the post-Yugoslav music scene.

The first homegrown Polish reggae bands started in the 1980s with groups like Izrael. Singer and songwriter Alexander Barykin was considered the father of Russian reggae.[80] In Sweden, Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees from across Northern Europe and features Swedish reggae bands such as Rootvälta and Svenska Akademien as well as many popular Jamaican artists. Summerjam, Europe's biggest reggae festival, takes place in Cologne, Germany, and sees crowds of 25,000 or more. Rototom Sunsplash, a week-long festival which used to take place in Osoppo, Italy, until 2009, is now held in Benicassim, Spain, and gathers up to 150,000 visitors every year.

In Iceland reggae band Hjálmar is well established having released six CDs in Iceland. They were the first reggae band in Iceland, but few Icelandic artists had written songs in the reggae style before their arrival on the Icelandic music scene. The Icelandic reggae scene is expanding and growing at a fast rate. RVK Soundsystem is the first Icelandic sound system, counting five DJs. They hold reggae nights in Reykjavík every month at clubs Hemmi og Valdi and more recently in Faktorý as the crowd has grown so much.

In Germany, the three successful Reggae Summerjam open-air festivals were crucial parts of the renaissance of Caribbean music in Germany but in 1990, conflict broke out between the two main German promoters who had cooperated so well during the previous seasons. With a lot of infighting and personal quarrels, each of them pursued his own preparations for a big summer festival. The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.

The 1990 Reggae Summerjam was staged as usual, but for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphitheater, with artists like Mad Professor's Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.

The other, ex-partner of the once-united promoters succeeded in bringing the original Sunsplash package to Germany for the first time. Close to the Main River in the little village of Gemaunden deep in rural south-central Germany, they staged a two-day festival that drew a bigger crowd. About 10,000 people came from all over the country as well as from neighboring states like trance[clarification needed] and, for the first time, East Germany to see the lineup of top reggae artists.[81]

Reggae in Africa was much boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe on Independence Day 18 April 1980. Nigerian reggae had developed in the 1970s with artists such as Majek Fashek proving popular.  In South Africa, reggae music has played a unifying role amongst cultural groups in Cape Town. During the years of Apartheid, the music bonded people from all demographic groups. Lucky Dube recorded 25 albums, fusing reggae with Mbaqanga. The Marcus Garvey Rasta camp in Phillipi is regarded by many to be the reggae and Rastafari center of Cape Town. Reggae bands play regularly at community centres such as the Zolani center in Nyanga.

In Uganda musician Papa Cidy is very popular. Arthur Lutta is also a Ugandan gospel reggae drummer known for his reggae style drumming. In Ethiopia, Dub Colossus and Invisible System emerged in 2008 sharing core members, and have received wide acclaim.[82][83][84] In Mali, Askia Modibo fuses reggae with Malian music. In Malawi, Black Missionaries produced nine albums. In Ivory Coast a country where reggae music is extremely popular, Tiken Jah Fakoly fuses reggae with traditional music. Alpha Blondy from Ivory Coast sings reggae with religious lyrics. In Sudan, beats, drums and bass guitar from reggae have been adopted by local music. Reggae is very popular there among generations from young to old; some spiritual (religious) groups grow dreadlocks and feature reggae beats in their chants.

In the Philippines, several bands and sound systems play reggae and dancehall music. Their music is called Pinoy reggae. Japanese reggae emerged in the early 1980s. Reggae is becoming more prevalent in Thailand as well. Reggae music is quite popular in Sri Lanka. Aside from the reggae music and Rastafari influences seen ever more on Thailand's islands and beaches, a true reggae sub-culture is taking root in Thailand's cities and towns. Many Thai artists, such as Job 2 Do, keep the tradition of reggae music and ideals alive in Thailand.

Famous Indian singer Kailash Kher and music producer Clinton Cerejo created Kalapi, a rare fusion piece of reggae and Indian music for Coke Studio India.[85] Other than this high-profile piece, reggae is confined to a small, emerging scene in India.[86]Reggae Rajahs are a reggae and bass music sound system crew based out of New Delhi, India.[87] They are the first Jamaican style sound system in India and creators of Goa Sunsplash Festival.[86][88]Thaikkudam Bridge, a neo-Indian band based in Kerala, India, is known for introducing reggae into Indian regional blues.[89]

Reggae in Australia originated in the 1980s. Australian reggae groups include Sticky Fingers, Blue King Brown and Astronomy Class.

By the end of the 1980s, the local music scene in Hawaii was dominated by Jawaiian music, a local form of reggae.

New Zealand reggae was heavily inspired by Bob Marley's 1979 tour of the country and early reggae groups such as Herbs.[90] The genre has seen many bands like Fat Freddy's Drop, Salmonella Dub, the Black Seeds and Katchafire emerging in more recent times, often involving fusion with electronica.[91]

In 2017[92] the first-ever chart dedicated to reggae and dancehall music was established in Australia by radio presenter DJ Ragz,[93] music producer DJ Wade[94] and Dancehall Reggae Australia.[95][96]"
"Reggae fusion","

Reggae fusion is a fusion genre of reggae that mixes reggae and/or dancehall with other genres, such as pop, rock, hip-hop/rap, R&B, jazz, funk, soul, disco, electronic, and Latin music, amongst others.[1][6][7]

Artists have been mixing reggae with other genres from as early as the early 1970s, but initially they were described using terms that joined the various genres they performed (e.g. ""reggae funk"", ""reggae pop"", ""reggae-disco""). It was not until the late 1990s that the term ""reggae fusion"" was coined.[8]

The subgenre predominantly evolved from late 1980s and early 1990s dancehall music which instrumentals or ""riddims"" contained elements from the R&B and hip hop genres. Due to this, some consider dancehall artists such as Mad Cobra, Shabba Ranks, Super Cat, Buju Banton and Tony Rebel as pioneers of reggae fusion.[9] For some of these artists, among them Buju Banton, reggae fusion became a staple throughout their careers. However, reggae fusion can be traced back to before the success of these artists, as far back as the late 1970s and early 1980s, with such songs as ""Pass the Dutchie"", and the band Third World blazed the trail, finding international success with songs such as ""Now That We Found Love"" and ""Try Jah Love"".[10] Therefore, Third World can be seen as arguably the original pioneers of reggae fusion leading the way for groups such as UB40 and Steel Pulse.

Although there were a few recognized reggae fusion artists in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, including the aforementioned acts in addition to others such as Sublime, Maxi Priest, Shinehead, 311, First Light, the Police and Inner Circle, their style of fusing genres was subtly done.[11][12] Artists such as Diana King, Patra, Buju Banton, Ini Kamoze, Snow and Shabba Ranks followed in their footsteps, however, creating a less subtle fusion by further blending heavier Jamaican dialect as well as more hardcore and sexual lyrics in their songs.[13] This led to a lot of crossover success for these artists with songs such as ""Informer"" and ""Here Comes the Hotstepper"" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping charts all around the world. As the subgenre began to take shape, the mid- to late 1990s saw artists becoming more innovative as many began to mix genres that were not similar nor typically associated with reggae, such as techno and house, leading to the subgenre gaining a more distinctive following and really beginning to grow.[9] Ironically, however, a major contributing factor to the subgenre garnering further international prominence was due to the lack of marketability of dancehall, especially in its rawest form, in the United States.

By the late 1990s, dancehall had lost its footing in the American market. While it was initially an appreciated novelty, it had gotten too hardcore lyrically. Further, vocalists started using even heavier Jamaican dialect and less standard English; this made it harder for a wider audience to understand what was being said. It had also come under heavy criticism from the international markets due to the homophobic lyrical content which sought to bash, condemn and instigate violence against the act as well as those who supported or participated in the lifestyle.[14] This led dancehall artists who were trying to break into the U.S. market, to fuse the dancehall style of toasting or deejaying over softer and predominantly pop and hip hop instrumentals as well as to diversify the content of their songs while moving away from homophobic lyrics. Traditional dancehall acts, such as Shaggy and Beenie Man experienced commercial success in the American markets with the release of their albums in 2000.[7][15][16] Shaggy had previously experienced multiple chart successes in the '90s but it was his album, Hot Shot, that especially helped further propel the subgenre internationally, as his album spawned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, ""It Wasn't Me"" and ""Angel"".[7][16]No Doubt's 2002 massive hit album Rock Steady, with worldwide reggae fusion hits such as ""Underneath it All"" featuring Lady Saw and ""Hey Baby"" featuring Bounty Killer, further propelled the subgenre's popularity to new heights. This was especially because it marked one of the first times a pop/ska punk act had made a complete reggae fusion album since the mid-'90s and opened up the genre to a new fan base as reggae fusion was, at that point, mainly utilized by reggae artists trying to break into the mainstream market and not by already established acts, such as No Doubt.[17] The early 2000s also saw Sean Paul achieve tremendous success internationally with singles such as ""Baby Boy"", ""Breathe"", ""Like Glue"" and ""Make It Clap"", among many others.[18] His albums Dutty Rock and The Trinity altogether spawned five top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits between 2002 and 2006, including the number-one hits ""Get Busy"" and ""Temperature"".

In the early 1990s, the evolution of reggae fusion reached another musical style in Europe with the worldwide number-one hits ""All That She Wants"", ""The Sign"", ""Happy Nation"" and ""Don't Turn Around"" by Ace of Base. Eurodance artists such as Dr. Alban, Dreamhouse, E-Rotic and the Vengaboys also regularly fused their style with reggae. The sound was often called Euro reggae and became a trend of Eurodance music, including such songs as Mr. President's ""Coco Jamboo"", Tatjana's ""Sweet Sweet Smile"", E-Rotic's ""Help Me Dr. Dick"", Rollergirl's ""Ole Ole Singin' Ole Ola"", Garcia's ""Bamboleo"", Maribel Gonzalez (M:G)'s ""If You Think"", DJ BoBo's ""It's My Life"", T-Spoon's ""Sex on the Beach"" and Vengaboys' ""We're Going to Ibiza"" and ""Uncle John from Jamaica"".[19]

The first reggae fusion-influenced riddim was produced in 2005 by Cordell ""Skatta"" Burrell, which featured deejays on a techno-based instrumental.[20][21] Reggae fusion is now a regular staple on Jamaican radio stations, especially Zip 103 FM, in the form of singles, mixes and remixes. This has led to more reggae fusion hits being produced as well as making strong waves on the dancehall charts in Jamaica. One such single, ""Ramping Shop"" (using the same instrumental of Ne-Yo's ""Miss Independent"") by Vybz Kartel and Spice, was one of the biggest reggae fusion hits in 2008, not to mention one of the top singles in Jamaica of that year, peaking at number one.

Its continued exposure to Jamaicans became very evident in 2009, as the summer saw an explosion of Jamaican-produced reggae fusion riddims such as ""Mood Swing"" (which yielded the massive breakout number-one hit ""Life"" by G-Whizz)[22] and hit tracks such as ""Holiday"" by Ding Dong and ""(From Mawning) Never Change"" by Chino. Both of these songs reached the top five on the Jamaican charts, with the former track peaking at number one in December 2009[23] and both (along with ""Life"") being nominated for ""Song of the Year"" at the 2010 EME Music Awards (Jamaican equivalent to the Grammy Awards), which was won by ""Holiday"".[24] This marked the first time a reggae fusion song had won the prestigious award since the award show's conception in 2008 as well as the first time three reggae fusion songs were nominated for the award. ""Holiday"" was also nominated and won for the ""Best Collaboration"".[25] Since 2010, reggae fusion has become a regular component of dancehall music and is as popular as it has ever been, being incorporated in such riddims as the popular ""One Day"" riddim produced by Seanizzle.

In 2011, Shaggy established a reggae fusion record label called Ranch Entertainment. It was intended to be launched in the summer of 2012.[26]

Its growth locally, however, has not come without its criticisms as some feel that the subgenre only serves to dilute the raw sound of reggae and their musical culture.[13] This controversy was further heightened in 2012, during the Jamaica 50th anniversary campaign to celebrate the country's 50th year of independence, as two vastly different songs were recognized as 'Jamaica 50' campaign songs, one which was a reggae fusion song entitled ""On a Mission"" produced by Shaggy and the other a roots reggae song entitled ""Find a Flag"" written by Mikey Bennett.[27] While ""On a Mission"" was recognized as the official anniversary song and was applauded by some, it received its fair share of negative feedback due to many questioning its inauthentic Jamaican sound. Popular dancehall artist Mr. Vegas spoke out against the use of the song being quoted as saying: ""It doesn't represent Jamaica 50, it doesn't reflect our culture or where our music is coming from.""[13][28] In 2014, following the growth of dance music in Jamaica, legendary reggae musician Richie Stephens sought to capitalize on this by launching a new riddim called 'Skatech' which was an amalgamation of Jamaican ska and electronic dance music. Stephens believed that due to ska not being at the forefront of Jamaican music for many years, combining it with something fresh could bring it back into the spotlight.[3][29] This provided a different and positive counterargument to the criticism of reggae fusion in Jamaican music, as it was here being used to bring the original forms of reggae back into the limelight, not to drown it out or dilute it as critics would posit.

Drake was heavily criticized in 2016 from fans when it was realized that Popcaan's verse from ""Controlla"" was removed from the album version on Views, causing many to accuse him of cultural appropriation. Prior to the album's release, two tracks were leaked online, one of which was ""Controlla"" featuring Popcaan. When the album was released and it no longer featured Popcaan, many fans became irate.[30][31][32][33] Popcaan, however, said he was happy for the exposure and understood that it was a business decision.[33]

Through other Caribbean-born artists such as Sean Paul, Damian Marley, Sean Kingston, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna who emerged during the mid-2000s, the popularity of the subgenre has continued to grow.[13] International reggae fusion hits, such as ""Calabria 2007"" by Enur feat. Natasja Saad, ""Need U Bad"" by Jazmine Sullivan, ""Say Hey (I Love You)"" by Michael Franti & Spearhead featuring Cherine Anderson and ""Billionaire"" by Travis McCoy, show that the subgenre has matured and is as popular as it has ever been, with more artists experimenting with it.[7] Jamaican singer Tessanne Chin is one of the latest reggae fusion artists reaching international fame following her winning Season 5 of NBC's reality TV singing competition The Voice as part of Adam Levine's team.[34] Later in 2014, Canadian reggae fusion band, Magic!, scored a worldwide number-one hit with their single ""Rude"".[35] It was the beginning of a major resurgence of the genre as this was followed later in 2015 by another number-one reggae fusion song when Jamaican artist OMI claimed the top spot with the Felix Jaehn remix to his song ""Cheerleader"".[2] ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber, ""Work"" by Rihanna, ""One Dance"" by Drake, ""Cheap Thrills"" by Sia, ""Locked Away"" by R. City, ""All in My Head (Flex)"" by Fifth Harmony, and in 2017 starting with ""Shape of You"" by Ed Sheeran also became international hits between late 2015 and early 2017 with all except ""Locked Away"" and ""All in My Head"" topping the Billboard Hot 100. R. City are known primarily for their songwriting and production many of which include reggae fusion tracks such as ""Take You There"" and ""Replay"", which they helped co-write. Other producers have also gained recognition for consistently incorporating reggae fusion into songs they produce, such as Major Lazer and J. R. Rotem, who has produced reggae fusion hits such as ""Beautiful Girls"", ""Me Love"", ""Take You There"", ""Replay"" and ""Solo"".[36][37]

A new generation of musicians are largely to thank for the prominence of reggae fusion in the last few years. Dancehall music saw a decline on the international stage over the last decade but the genre is now seeing a resurgence back into the mainstream of music leading to many dancehall-inspired tracks.[30] In 2016, a decade after Sean Paul's last triumph on the Billboard Hot 100, it was abundantly clear that larger audiences finally seemed receptive to this sound again.[38][39][40] Coincidentally, Sean Paul himself, seemed to reemerge as a popular featured act as he was called up for guest appearances with pop artists such as Little Mix, Jay Sean, Enrique Iglesias and Sia, with his collaborations with the latter two, ""Bailando"" and ""Cheap Thrills"" respectively, becoming major international hits and ""Cheap Thrills"" becoming #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Artists such as Meghan Trainor, Alicia Keys, Nico & Vinz, Calvin Harris, Ariana Grande, Twenty One Pilots, Clean Bandit and Britney Spears also made forays into the genre with songs ""Better"", ""In Common"", ""Imagine"", ""My Way"", ""Side to Side"", sleeper hit ""Ride"", ""Rockabye"" and ""Slumber Party"", respectively.[38][41] Drake, however, has been an unlikely talisman of the genre beginning as early from his 2010 single, ""Find Your Love"" and culminating in his latest works, particularly his fourth mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late and his fourth studio album, Views, both of which feature heavy dancehall influences and popular dancehall acts such as Popcaan and reggae fusion singles ""One Dance"", ""Controlla"" and ""Too Good"".[38][40][42] Fellow Canadian act Tory Lanez, whose parents are both from Caribbean islands, also had a major breakout in 2016 with ""Luv"", which sampled the late '90s dancehall classic ""Everyone Falls in Love"" by Tanto Metro and Devonte.[42]

With the use of the dancehall's signature tempo on the albums of major music players such as Drake, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Kanye West and more, the genre has become so popular that Apple Music started their own dancehall inspired playlist.[43][44] This level of popularity has not been seen since Sean Paul followed in the path of Shaggy's crossover success and opened the flood gates for some of the Caribbean's brightest talents to find their way onto mainstream radio in the early 2000s.[39]

Other major pop artistes continued to venture into the dancehall-pop genre in 2017 with Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, and Calvin Harris, having hits with ""Shape of You"", ""Chained to the Rhythm"" and ""Feels"" respectively.[45][46][47][48][49]

"Reggaeton","Reggaeton (UK: /ˈrɛɡeɪtoʊn, ˌrɛɡeɪˈtɒn/,[5][6] US: /ˌrɛɡeɪˈtoʊn, ˌreɪɡ-/),[7][8] also known as reggaetón or reguetón,[9] (Spanish: [reɣeˈton]) is a modern style of popular and electronic music that originated in Panamá during the late 1980s, and which rose to prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s through a plethora of Puerto Rican musicians.[10][11][12] It has been popularized and dominated by artists from Puerto Rico since the early 1990s.[3]
It has evolved from dancehall, with elements of hip hop, Latin American, and Caribbean music. Vocals include toasting/rapping and singing, typically in Spanish.
Reggaetón, today, is regarded as one of the most popular music genres, worldwide; it is the top music genre among the Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations and one of the primary modern genres within the Spanish-language music industry. Seemingly endless artists from the Caribbean have risen to fame (Puerto Rico, Panamá, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Colombia). Argentina has seen a modern surge in young artists inspired by the reggaetón style, fusing their music with Spanish rap verses, trapetón and R&B-style vocals (such as the “Los Del Espacio”, including LIT killah, Tiago PZK, Duki, Emilia, and María Becerra, as well as Argentine pop star Tini).
Several established, world-famous performers—notably Puerto Rican-American Jennifer Lopez and Shakira from Colombia—have embraced the style, recording numerous duets and collaborations with top reggaetoneros. Several other emerging international artists are seeing success in the genre as well, including Catalán-Spanish singer Bad Gyal (from Barcelona) and trilingual Brazilian star Anitta (from Rio de Janeiro). Mexican-American singer Becky G (from Los Angeles, California) has experienced huge success in recent years, as a Latino American artist in the reggaetón genre.[13] In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his smash single “Gasolina”, regarded by many as the first globally-successful reggaetón song; Daddy Yankee is credited with bringing the style to western pop music listeners. By the 2010s, the genre had seen increased popularity across Latin America, as well as modern acceptance within mainstream Western music; during the 2010s, several new award categories (focusing on reggaetón and Latin music) were unveiled at various American music awards shows, notably the English-language American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Grammy Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards.[14]
The dembow riddim was created by Jamaican dancehall producers during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Dembow consists of a kick drum, kickdown drum, palito, snare drum, timbal, timballroll and (sometimes) a high-hat cymbal. Dembow's percussion pattern was influenced by dancehall and other West Indian music (soca, calypso and cadence); this gives dembow a pan-Caribbean flavor. Steely & Clevie, creators of the Poco Man Jam riddim, are usually credited with the creation of dembow.[56] At its heart is the 3+3+2 (tresillo) rhythm, complemented by a bass drum in 4/4 time.[57]
The riddim was first highlighted by Shabba Ranks in Dem Bow, from his 1991 album Just Reality. To this day, elements of the song's accompaniment track are found in over 80% of all reggaeton productions.[58] During the mid-1980s, dancehall music was revolutionized by the electronic keyboard and drum machine; subsequently, many dancehall producers used them to create different dancehall riddims. Dembow's role in reggaeton is a basic building block, a skeletal sketch in percussion.
In Reggaeton 'dembow' also incorporates identical Jamaican riddims such as Bam Bam, Hot This Year, Poco Man Jam, Fever Pitch, Red Alert, Trailer Reloaded and Big Up riddims, and several samples are often used. Some reggaeton hits incorporate a lighter, electrified version of the riddim. Examples are Pa' Que la Pases Bien and Quiero Bailar, which uses the Liquid riddim.[59] Since 2018 a new variation of the Dembow rhythm has emerged; Starting with Te Bote, a sharper minimalist Dembow has become a stable of Reggaeton production which has allowed for more syncopated rhythmic experiments.[60] [61]"
"Roots reggae","

Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of Africans and those in the African Diaspora, including the spiritual side of Rastafari, black liberation,  revolution and the honouring of God, called Jah by Rastafarians.[1] It is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer,[2] and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, struggles by artists, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to fascism, capitalism, corrupt government and racial oppression. A spiritual repatriation to Africa is a common theme in roots reggae.

The increasing influence of the Rastafari movement after the visit of Haile Selassie to Jamaica in 1966 played a major part in the development of roots reggae, with spiritual themes becoming more common in reggae lyrics in the late 1960s.[1] Important early roots reggae releases included Winston Holness's ""Blood & Fire"" (1970) and Yabby You's ""Conquering Lion"" (1972).[1] Political unrest also played its part, with the 1972 election campaign of Michael Manley targeting the support of Jamaica's ghetto communities.[1] Increasing violence associated with the opposing political parties was also a common lyrical theme, with tracks such as Junior Murvin's ""Police & Thieves"" and Culture's ""Two Sevens Clash"".[1]

The heyday of roots reggae is usually considered the latter half of the 1970s – with artists such as The Abyssinians, Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Horace Andy, Hugh Mundell, and Lincoln Thompson, and groups like Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse, Israel Vibration, The Gladiators and Culture – teaming up with producers such as Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Bunny Lee, Joseph Hoo Kim and Coxsone Dodd. The Sound system (Jamaican) was of unequalled importance in spreading reggae and dub, with the diaspora represented by leading sound system operators such as Jah Shaka, who, in turn, went on to profoundly influence many in Britain and the world, influencing early punk rock musicians in London, as well as definitively shaping later bass  dominated genres such as Jungle music and Drum and bass. The experimental pioneering of such producers within often-restricted technological parameters gave birth to dub, and is seen by some music historians as one of the earliest (albeit analogue) contributions to modern dance music production techniques.

Roots reggae became popular in Europe in the 1970s, especially among left-wing white youths in Western Europe.[3]The Wailers' popularity in Europe opened the door for other artists, and roots reggae artists became popular with punk rock fans.[1] When Jamaicans turned to dancehall, a lot of black, white and mixed roots reggae bands were formed in Europe.[1] Later on roots reggae made its way into the United States with the migration of Jamaicans to New York. This took place with the reforms made to American immigration laws in the early 1960s. Along with localised traditions and food, reggae music was inevitably brought as well, contributing to the New York City soundscape, such as the development of hip hop.[4]

While roots reggae was largely overtaken in popularity in Jamaica by dancehall, several artists from the original era, such as Culture, Burning Spear, and Israel Vibration continued to produce roots reggae, and artists like Beres Hammond and Freddie McGregor continued the use of roots reggae, as a musical style and thematically, through the 1980s. In the 1990s younger Jamaican artists became interested in the Rastafari movement and began incorporating roots themes into their music. Most notable among the new generation of ""conscious"" artists was Garnett Silk, whose positive spiritual message and consistent use of roots and rocksteady riddims gave him cross generational appeal with Caribbean audiences. While other notable dancehall stars like Capleton and Buju Banton became devout Rastas and changed their musical direction as a result.[1] Other modern roots artists and bands also emerged at this time, including Luciano, Junior Kelly, Morgan Heritage, Anthony B,  and Sizzla.[2]

Similar to the oversimplification and limitations of the terminology middle passage, the roots reggae displays Africa as a mythical paradise that functions primarily as a motivating symbol, imagined origin, and semantic center. ""More so even than earlier sounds, roots reggae always seemed to invite itself directly to Africa, brazenly insisting upon itself as the continent's primary echo, if not recursive mirror"". The mythical Africa articulated in roots reggae is shaped by desire, nostalgia and trauma under the pressure of local Caribbean politics. While an imagined Africa is used as an inspiration for resistance and revolution against ""Babylon"" (corrupted capitalist colonial culture), Africa's actual complexity and contradictions are not investigated.[5]

Traditional reggae and roots reggae, a subgenre that evolved from traditional reggae, while sharing a common Jamaican heritage, exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart. Traditional reggae encompasses diverse themes, including love, everyday life, and dancehall culture, whereas roots reggae tends to focus its lyrics on social consciousness.[2] Traditional reggae rhythms vary widely, featuring both upbeat and slower tunes. In contrast, roots reggae is marked by a deliberate one-drop rhythm and a slower tempo. Rooted in a deep social and political consciousness, its lyrics often tackle issues of poverty, oppression, and spirituality, influenced by the Rastafarian movement.[6] Musically, roots reggae maintains a specific sonic identity, characterised by deep basslines, skanking guitar patterns, and the inclusion of horns.[1] While these distinctions exist, the lines between reggae and roots reggae can be flexible, and the two genres share a significant overlap within the broader reggae musical landscape."
"Latin alternative","Latin alternative, or ""alterlatino"", or ""Patchanka"",[1] is a brand of Latin rock music produced by combining genres like alternative rock, lofi, chillout, metal, electronica, hip hop, new wave, pop rock, punk rock, reggae, and ska with traditional Ibero-American sounds, in Latin Europeans and Latin Americans countries (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French and Catalan languages).

Rock music has been produced in Iberian America since the late 1950s. Some rock bands started to use unusual instruments such as maracas and quenas. In the late 1960s, artists like Santana started using a different technique to make rock music; by incorporating influences of Latin jazz. Its sound was incorporated by young Latino-players in the US, as an answer to the rock en Español movement in Americas and Spain led by bands like Héroes del Silencio, Caifanes or Los Prisioneros.

In the early 1990s, it was used by Mexican bands such as Maldita Vecindad and Café Tacuba, they were accepted on the Latino circuit in the US, especially by the Mexican community. Subsequently, experimental musician Lynda Thomas earned recognition and commercial success with alternative music in the same decade.

With the passage of time and many musical styles in the US-Latin, Latin alternative has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself. Today, many music journalists and fans regard Latin alternative as a subgenre of rock en Español, and like rock en Español, it may be further divided into more specific genres of music.

The most known event of Latin alternative is the Latin Alternative Music Conference (LAMC) that every year gathers a large number of bands from all over the Americas and Spain. The conference was co-founded by artist manager Tomas Cookman and music executive Josh Norek. It was first held in New York City in 2000, moved briefly to Los Angeles, and then returned to New York. The 2009 event featured artists from across the Americas including Argentina's Juana Molina, Puerto Rican hip-hop and reggaeton outfit Calle 13, Colombian group Bomba Estéreo, Brazilian singer-songwriter Curumin and Mexico's Natalia Lafourcade, and was profiled along with the wider Latin alternative scene in an article in The New York Times.[2]"
"Bolero","Bolero is a genre of song which originated in eastern Cuba in the late 19th century as part of the trova tradition. Unrelated to the older Spanish dance of the same name, bolero is characterized by sophisticated lyrics dealing with love. It has been called the ""quintessential Latin American romantic song of the twentieth century"".[1]

Unlike the simpler, thematically diverse canción, bolero did not stem directly from the European lyrical tradition, which included Italian opera and canzone, popular in urban centers like Havana at the time. Instead, it was born as a form of romantic folk poetry cultivated by a new breed of troubadour from Santiago de Cuba, the trovadores.[1]Pepe Sánchez is considered the father of this movement and the author of the first bolero, ""Tristezas"", written in 1883.[2] Originally, boleros were sung by individual trovadores while playing guitar. Over time, it became common for trovadores to play in groups as dúos, tríos, cuartetos, etc. Thanks to the Trío Matamoros and, later, Trío Los Panchos, bolero achieved widespread popularity in Latin America, the United States and Spain. At the same time, Havana had become a fertile ground where bolero composers met to create compositions and improvise new tunes; it was the so-called filin movement, which derived its name from the English word ""feeling"". Many of the genre's most enduring pieces were written then and popularized in radio and cabaret performances by singers such as Olga Guillot and Elena Burke, backed by orchestras and big bands.[3]

Boleros are generally in 4/4 time and, musically, compositions and arrangements might take a variety of forms. This flexibility has enabled boleros to feature in the repertoire of Cuban son and rumba ensembles, as well as Spanish copla and flamenco singers, since the early 20th century. Occasionally, boleros have been merged with other forms to yield new subgenres, such as the bolero-son, popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and the bolero-cha, popular in the 1950s. In the United States, the rhumba ballroom dance emerged as an adaptation of the bolero-son in the 1930s. Boleros can also be found in the African rumba repertoire of many artists from Kinshasa to Dakar, due to the many bolero records that were distributed to radios there as part of the G.V. Series.

The popularity of the genre has also been felt as far as Vietnam, where it became a fashionable song style in South Vietnam before the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and remains popular with Vietnamese.

In Cuba, the bolero was perhaps the first great Cuban musical and vocal synthesis to win universal recognition.[4] In 24 time, this dance music spread to other countries, leaving behind what Ed Morales has called the ""most popular lyric tradition in Latin America.""[5]

The Cuban bolero tradition originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century;[6] it does not owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name. In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar.

Pepe Sanchez is known as the father of the trova style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and students wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.[7][8]

The bolero first spread from the east of Cuba to the Dominican Republic in the year 1895, thanks to trovador Sindo Garay, who had previously brought the criolla ""La Dorila"" to Cuba, giving rise to a lasting interchange of lyrical styles between both islands.[9] In the early 20th century the bolero reached Puerto Rico and Mexico, where it was popularized by the first radio stations around 1915.[9] In Mexico, the genre became an essential component of the thriving trova yucateca movement in Yucatán alongside other Cuban forms such as the clave. It leading exponent was Guty Cárdenas.[1]

By the 1930s, when Trío Matamoros made famous their mix of bolero and son cubano known as bolero-son, the genre was a staple of the musical repertoire of most Latin American countries.[10] In Spain, Cuban bolero was incorporated into the copla repertoire with added elements from Andalusian music, giving rise to the so-called bolero moruno, made famous by composers such as Carmelo Larrea and Quintero, León y Quiroga.[11]

Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, as in the case of the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández and the Mexican composers: Agustín Lara and María Grever. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are primarily considered trovadores.[12][13][14][15] Several lyric tenors also contributed to the popularization of the bolero throughout North and South America  during the 1930s and the 1940s through live concerts and performances on international radio networks. Included in this group were the Mexican operatic tenors: Juan Arvizu[16][17][18][19] and Nestor Mesta Chayres.[20][21][22]  Their collaborations in New York City with such musicians as Alfredo Antonini, Terig Tucci, Elsa Miranda and John Serry Sr. on the CBS radio show Viva América also introduced the bolero to millions of listeners throughout the United States.[23] Also noteworthy during the 1940s and 1950s were the performances of Trio Los Panchos, which featured the artistry of musicians from Mexico and Puerto Rico including: Chucho Navarro, Alfredo Gil and Hernando Avilés.[24][25]  Boleros saw a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s when Mexican singer Luis Miguel was credited for reviving interest in the bolero genre following the release Romance.[26]

José Loyola comments that the frequent fusions of the bolero with other Cuban rhythms is one of the reasons it has been so fertile for such a long period of time:

This adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:

The lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music.

Bolero music has also spread to Vietnam. In the 1930s, the nation grew fond of modern music, which combined Western elements with traditional music. Vietnamese bolero is generally slower tempo compared to Hispanic bolero, and is similar in style to Japanese enka and Korean trot.[28] Such music was romantic, expressing concepts of feelings, love, and life in a poetic language;[29] this predisposition was hated by Viet Minh, who strived towards shaping the working class at the time.[30]

This genre became colloquially known as yellow music, in opposition to the nhạc đỏ (red music) endorsed by the Communist government of Hanoi during the era of the Vietnam War.  As a result of North Vietnam winning the war, the music was banned in 1975. Those caught listening to yellow music would be punished, and their music confiscated. After the Fall of Saigon, many Vietnamese migrated to the United States, taking their music with them. The ban was lightened in 1986, when love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry was killed.[30]

The government of Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like Asia and Paris by Night. In recent years however, bolero had grown popular again, as more overseas singers performed in Vietnam. Additionally, singing competition television series like Boléro Idol have grown popular, with singers performing songs, including songs formerly banned.[30]

A version of the Cuban bolero is danced throughout the Latin dance world (supervised by the World Dance Council) under the misnomer ""rumba"", often spelled ""rhumba"". This came about in the early 1930s when a simple overall term was needed to market Cuban music to audiences unfamiliar with the various Cuban musical terms. The famous ""Peanut Vendor"", actually a son-pregón, was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.[31][32]

In Cuba, the bolero is usually written in 24 time, elsewhere often 44. The tempo for dance is about 120 beats per minute. The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow son, which is the reason it may be best described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The slow (over the two beats four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.[33]

The dance known as bolero is  one of the competition dances in American Rhythm ballroom dance category. The first step is typically taken on the first beat, held during the second beat with two more steps falling on beats three and four (cued as ""slow-quick-quick"").  In competitive dance the music is in 44 time and will range between 96 and 104 bpm. This dance is quite different from the other American Rhythm dances in that it not only requires cuban motion but rises and falls such as found in waltz and contra body movement.[34] Popular music for this dance style need not be Latin in origin. Lists of music used in competitions for American Rhythm Bolero are available.[35]"
"Cumbia","Cumbia refers to a number of musical rhythms and folk dance traditions of Latin America, generally involving musical and cultural elements from American Indigenous peoples, Europeans and African slaves during colonial times.[1] Cumbia is said to have come from funeral traditions in the Afro-Colombian community.

Cumbia traditionally uses three drums (tambora, tambor alegre [es] and llamador), three flutes (gaita hembra and gaito macho, both forms of Colombian flute [es], and flauta de millo) and has a 22 or 24 meter.[2] The sound of cumbia can be characterized as having a simple ""chu-chucu-chu"" rhythm created by the guacharaca.[3] The genre frequently incorporates brass instruments and piano.
In order to properly understand the interlocking relationship between cumbia's roots and its Pan-American (and then global) routes, Colombia's geocultural complexities must first be taken into account to comprehend the genre and its subgenres.

Most Hispanic American countries have made their own regional version of Cumbia, some of them with their own particularity.

Examples of cumbia include:

Cumbia's background came from the coastal region of Colombia.[7] To be more specific, its dance came from a coastal traditional culture, as cumbia had multiple ethnic influences that originated from this region. One of the biggest factors of its heritage is the African influences that was brought over by the African slaves imported from the colonization of the Spaniards. The influence came from the costeño[8] dance. Another influence was the integration of Spanish people. The Spanish folksongs with influences from the indigenous caused the fusion of races and the elements of their cultures were likewise fused.[9]

The history of cumbia has evolved throughout the years, known as a street dance but had a period of transiting into a ballroom dance.[10] Cumbia is commonly known for having many subgenres from different countries which contributes to the different dance styles known. Cumbia can be referred to as a folk dance while also being known globally as a street dance. To better understand what the dances of cumbia resemble it's better to know the basics of the dance. Cumbia is danced in pairs, consisting the amorous conquest of a woman by a man. This is crucial since the dance from the Atlantic coast[11] has the woman holding a candle in her right hand. This serves as two narrative functions; one to light the way for the dancing woman and the latter for a more serious motif. The latter can be portrayed in an imaginative sentence as a weapon by which the woman defends herself against the advances of her partner.[11]

Since the 1950s, cumbia has been an art form that is stylized, orchestrated and lyricized, contrary to the traditional form. This has diverged through the years and the world-known genre even had a brief period in the 1970s where it lost its popularity.

As the genre evolved, it expanded throughout Latin America. The expansion has led to the creation of new variations on the form, and international recognition of the genre changed public perceptions. Cumbia almost disappeared in Colombia in the 1970s after the introduction of salsa. Although that was detrimental it could be argued that cumbia found stability in Central America, Mexico, and Peru.[12] The transformation of cumbia in other countries to better align with the taste of populations with very different aesthetic traditions from the strongly African-derived coastal culture[13] from which it originally emerged.

Representing cumbia being perceived as expressing the harmonious outcome of racial and cultural blending, this socially affected the public views on the region's highly discriminated mestizo working class. Socially and economically some changed their views on mestizos due to cumbia being a large factor in shaping their perspective - except in Argentina, where it's still largely seen as vulgar and offensive by much of the middle class and has thus mostly helped reinforce lower class stereotypes.[14]"
"Vallenato","

Vallenato (.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}Latin American Spanish pronunciation: [baʝeˈnato]), is a popular folk music genre from Colombia. It primarily comes from its Caribbean region. Vallenato literally means ""born in the valley"".  The valley influencing this name is located between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía de Perijá in north-east Colombia. The name also applies to the people from the city where this genre originated: Valledupar (from the place named Valle de Upar – ""Valley of Upar""). In 2006, vallenato and cumbia were added as a category in the Latin Grammy Awards. Colombia's traditional vallenato music is Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, according to UNESCO.[1]

This form of music originated from farmers who, keeping a tradition of Spanish minstrels (juglares in Spanish), used to travel through the region with their cattle in search of pastures or to sell them in cattle fairs. Because they traveled from town to town and the region lacked rapid communications, these farmers served as bearers of news for families living in other towns or villages. Their only form of entertainment during these trips was singing and playing guitars or indigenous gaita flutes, known as kuisis in the Kogi language, and their form of transmitting their news was by singing their messages.

The first form of vallenato was played with gaita flutes, guacharaca, and caja, and later adopted other instruments like guitars. These troubadors were later influenced by Europe's instruments: piano and accordion. Impressed by the sound of the accordion, troubadors probably later obtained accordions from Aruba and Curaçao. Vallenato was considered music of the lower class and farmers, but gradually started penetrating through every social group during the mid-20th century.

Don Clemente Quintero – a prominent member from the region's elite – was a lover of this music, usually accompanied by liquor, was a form of entertainment for this almost isolated region. He then decided to start a parranda (party) inside the very strict Valledupar Social Club with friends. This triggered an acceptance for the music and it became a regular feature at parties, carnivals and reunions, not for dancing, but for listening to these juglares stories [citation needed].

Alfonso López Michelsen, a prominent Colombian politician, showed interest in the region as his ancestors and wife were born there. While a Senator, he pushed for the creation of the Department of Cesar and became, in 1966, its first governor. Once in office and together with writer and reporter Consuelo Araújo Noguera and vallenato composer Rafael Escalona, they created the Vallenato Legend Festival.

Its three traditional instruments are:

Vallenato consists of four beats or ""airs"" that are differentiated through their rhythmic structure and the melody chord structure the accordionist gives it. These are son, paseo, merengue, and puya. The son and the paseo have a 24 time and the merengue and the puya a 68 time.[2]

The piqueria vallenata is a type of typical musical showdown Colombian Caribbean folklore and Vallenato. As in the contrapunteo Joropo burrowing, or trova paisa within the music, litigants demonstrate their improvisational skills in building verses that challenge their opponent. This type of musical confrontation arose as a result of chance encounters between vallenatos minstrels who roamed the northern part of Colombia brightening binges and to demonstrate their talent on the accordion and the art of improvisation faced with songs and rhymes. One of the most important meetings of the Piqueria was between Emiliano Zuleta and Lorenzo Morales, both vallenato accordionists.[3] From this meeting came the popular song ""La Gota Fría"" (""The Cold Drop"" in English), played in its most popular version by Colombian singer Carlos Vives.

Many vallenato festivals are held annually in Colombia, such as:

Thanks to the Vallenato Legend Festival, this musical genre became known through the region including regions of Venezuela, and when a popular telenovela, ""Escalona"", based on the life of Vallenato composer, Rafael Escalona was aired on national television (with vallenato superstar Carlos Vives as Escalona), vallenato became widely known in Colombia and internationally. Some renowned traditional vallenato performers are Guillermo Buitrago, Alejo Duran, Enrique Díaz, Emiliano Zuleta, Luis Enrique Martínez, Abel Antonio Villa and Lorenzo Morales. Other important characters such as Tobías Enrique Pumarejo and Rafael Escalona never played any instrument, but were important writers of very well known songs across Latin America. Other well-known Colombian musicians who sing vallenatos are Rafael Orozco Maestre, Miguel Morales, Diomedes Díaz, Jorge Oñate, Ivan Villazon, Nicolas ""Colacho"" Mendoza (accordion player and composer), Juan Humberto ""Juancho"" Rois (accordion player and composer), Omar Geles (accordion player and composer), Israel Romero, Peter Manjarrés, Silvestre Dangond, Los Gigantes Del Vallenato, Galy Galiano, and Lisandro Meza among others.

The current ambassador of the genre is Carlos Vives, who has progressively helped vallenato gain popularity worldwide by combining traditional vallenato music with pop/rock music, subgenre that has come to be known as ""vallenato-pop"".

The traditional vallenato developed into a more orchestra type of musical group. Throughout the years, some groups started adding instruments and a group chorus to support the main singer, popularly and sarcastically known as ""ay omberos"". With these changes. Some of the instruments added or used by some orchestras were: the bass guitar, the congas drums, a Timbal set, drum kit, maracas, guache, electric piano, Spanish guitars, tambourine, cowbell, electric guitar, Saxophone, piano accordion, violins, among others. These groups also started fusioning local genres to the vallenato, usually with cumbia, porro sabanero, gaitas (group of gaita flute interpreters), merecumbe and joropo. Some groups seeking a wider audience started mixing vallenato with other international genres, like salsa, merengue, rock, classical music, reggae, reggaeton, ranchera, techno and house music. Some of these mixes did not become very popular because of their experimental sounds.

La Nueva Ola refers to the new generation of vallenato groups and orchestras that have created a distinctive sound for themselves while keeping some of the essences of their predecessors. Kaleth Morales is considered the leading artist of this young wave of vallenato musical groups, even after his death following a car accident on August 24, 2005. The leader is now Silvestre Dangond, who won five awards in Premios Nuestra Tierra in 2009.[4] Other relevant artists are Silvestre Dangond, Peter Manjarrés and Martín Elías."
